# Quickstart: Build and run a container image using Azure Container Registry Tasks

In this quickstart, you use Azure Container Registry Tasks commands to quickly build, push, and run a Docker container image natively within Azure, showing how to offload your "inner-loop" development cycle to the cloud. [ACR Tasks][container-registry-tasks-overview] is a suite of features within Azure Container Registry to help you manage and modify container images across the container lifecycle. 

After this quickstart, explore more advanced features of ACR Tasks. ACR Tasks can automate image builds based on code commits or base image updates, or test multiple containers, in parallel, among other scenarios. 

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account][azure-account] before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to complete this quickstart. If you'd like to use it locally, version 2.0.58 or later is recommended. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Create a resource group

If you don't already have a container registry, first create a resource group with the [az group create][az-group-create] command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create a container registry

Create a container registry using the [az acr create][az-acr-create] command. The registry name must be unique within Azure, and contain 5-50 alphanumeric characters. In the following example, *myContainerRegistry008* is used. Update this to a unique value.

```azurecli-interactive
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerRegistry008 --sku Basic
```

This example creates a *Basic* registry,  a cost-optimized option for developers learning about Azure Container Registry. For details on available service tiers, see [Container registry SKUs][container-registry-skus].

## Build an image from a Dockerfile

Now use Azure Container Registry to build an image. First, create a working directory and then create a Dockerfile named *Dockerfile* with the following content. This is a simple example to build a Linux container image, but you can create your own standard Dockerfile and build images for other platforms.

```bash
echo "FROM hello-world" > Dockerfile
```

Run the [az acr build][az-acr-build] command to build the image. When successfully built, the image is pushed to your registry. The following example pushes the `sample/hello-world:v1` image. The `.` at the end of the command sets the location of the Dockerfile, in this case the current directory.

```azurecli-interactive
az acr build --image sample/hello-world:v1 --registry myContainerRegistry008 --file Dockerfile . 
```

Output from a successful build and push is similar to the following:

```

## Run the image

Now quickly run the image you built and pushed to your registry. In your container development workflow, this might be a validation step before you deploy the image.

Create a file *quickrun.yaml* in a local working directory with the following content for a single step. Substitute the login server name of your registry for *\<acrLoginServer\>*. The login server name is in the format *\<registry-name\>.azurecr.io* (all lowercase), for example, *mycontainerregistry008.azurecr.io*. This example assumes that you built and pushed the `sample/hello-world:v1` image in the previous section:

```yml
steps:
  - cmd: <acrLoginServer>/sample/hello-world:v1
```

The `cmd` step in this example runs the container in its default configuration, but `cmd` supports additional `docker run` parameters or even other `docker` commands.

Run the container with the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr run --registry myContainerRegistry008 --file quickrun.yaml .
```

Output is similar to the following:

```console

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

```

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete][az-group-delete] command to remove the resource group, the container registry, and the container images stored there.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you used features of ACR Tasks to quickly build, push, and run a Docker container image natively within Azure. Continue to the Azure Container Registry tutorials to learn about using ACR Tasks to automate image builds and updates.
