# Run multi-step build, test, and patch tasks in ACR Tasks

Multi-step tasks extend the single image build-and-push capability of ACR Tasks with multi-step, multi-container-based workflows. Use multi-step tasks to build and push several images, in series or in parallel. Then run those images as commands within a single task run. Each step defines a container image build or push operation, and can also define the execution of a container. Each step in a multi-step task uses a container as its execution environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you previously created tasks during the preview with the `az acr build-task` command, those tasks need to be re-created using the [az acr task][az-acr-task] command.

For example, you can run a task with steps that automate the following logic:

1. Build a web application image
1. Run the web application container
1. Build a web application test image
1. Run the web application test container which performs tests against the running application container
1. If the tests pass, build a Helm chart archive package
1. Perform a `helm upgrade` using the new Helm chart archive package

All steps are performed within Azure, offloading the work to Azure's compute resources and freeing you from infrastructure management. Besides your Azure container registry, you pay only for the resources you use. For information on pricing, see the **Container Build** section in [Azure Container Registry pricing][pricing].


## Common task scenarios

Multi-step tasks enable scenarios like the following logic:

* Build, tag, and push one or more container images, in series or in parallel.
* Run and capture unit test and code coverage results.
* Run and capture functional tests. ACR Tasks supports running more than one container, executing a series of requests between them.
* Perform task-based execution, including pre/post steps of a container image build.
* Deploy one or more containers with your favorite deployment engine to your target environment.

## Multi-step task definition

A multi-step task in ACR Tasks is defined as a series of steps within a YAML file. Each step can specify dependencies on the successful completion of one or more previous steps. The following task step types are available:

* [`build`](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md#build): Build one or more container images using familiar `docker build` syntax, in series or in parallel.
* [`push`](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md#push): Push built images to a container registry. Private registries like Azure Container Registry are supported, as is the public Docker Hub.
* [`cmd`](container-registry-tasks-reference-yaml.md#cmd): Run a container, such that it can operate as a function within the context of the running task. You can pass parameters to the container's `[ENTRYPOINT]`, and specify properties like env, detach, and other familiar `docker run` parameters. The `cmd` step type enables unit and functional testing, with concurrent container execution.

The following snippets show how to combine these task step types. Multi-step tasks can be as simple as building a single image from a Dockerfile and pushing to your registry, with a YAML file similar to:

```yml
version: v1.0.0
steps:
  - build: -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}} .
  - push: ["{{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}}"]
```

Or more complex, such as this fictitious multi-step definition which includes steps for build, test, helm package, and helm deploy (container registry and Helm repository configuration not shown):

```yml
version: v1.0.0
steps:
  - id: build-web
    build: -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world:{{.Run.ID}} .
    when: ["-"]
  - id: build-tests
    build -t {{.Run.Registry}}/hello-world-tests ./funcTests
    when: ["-"]
  - id: push
    push: ["{{.Run.Registry}}/helloworld:{{.Run.ID}}"]
    when: ["build-web", "build-tests"]
  - id: hello-world-web
    cmd: {{.Run.Registry}}/helloworld:{{.Run.ID}}
  - id: funcTests
    cmd: {{.Run.Registry}}/helloworld:{{.Run.ID}}
    env: ["host=helloworld:80"]
  - cmd: {{.Run.Registry}}/functions/helm package --app-version {{.Run.ID}} -d ./helm ./helm/helloworld/
  - cmd: {{.Run.Registry}}/functions/helm upgrade helloworld ./helm/helloworld/ --reuse-values --set helloworld.image={{.Run.Registry}}/helloworld:{{.Run.ID}}
```

See [task examples][task-examples] for complete multi-step task YAML files and Dockerfiles for several scenarios.

## Run a sample task

Tasks support both manual execution, called a "quick run," and automated execution on Git commit or base image update.

To run a task, you first define the task's steps in a YAML file, then execute the Azure CLI command [az acr run][az-acr-run].

Here's an example Azure CLI command that runs a task using a sample task YAML file. Its steps build and then push an image. Update `\<acrName\>` with the name of your own Azure container registry before running the command.

```azurecli
az acr run --registry <acrName> -f build-push-hello-world.yaml https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-tasks.git
```

When you run the task, the output should show the progress of each step defined in the YAML file. In the following output, the steps appear as `acb_step_0` and `acb_step_1`.

```console
$ az acr run --registry myregistry -f build-push-hello-world.yaml https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-tasks.git
