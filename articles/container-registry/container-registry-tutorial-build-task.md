# Tutorial: Automate container image builds in the cloud when you commit source code

In addition to a [quick task](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md), ACR Tasks supports automated Docker container image builds with the *build task*. In this tutorial, you use the Azure CLI to create a task that automatically triggers image builds in the cloud when you commit source code to a Git repository.

In this tutorial, part two in the series:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a task
> * Test the task
> * View task status
> * Trigger the task with a code commit

This tutorial assumes you've already completed the steps in the [previous tutorial](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md). If you haven't already done so, complete the steps in the [Prerequisites](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md#prerequisites) section of the previous tutorial before proceeding.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you'd like to use the Azure CLI locally, you must have Azure CLI version **2.0.46** or later installed  and logged in with [az login][az-login]. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade the CLI, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].

## Prerequisites

### Get sample code

This tutorial assumes you've already completed the steps in the [previous tutorial](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md), and have forked and cloned the sample repository. If you haven't already done so, complete the steps in the [Prerequisites](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md#prerequisites) section of the previous tutorial before proceeding.

### Container registry

You must have an Azure container registry in your Azure subscription to complete this tutorial. If you need a registry, see the [previous tutorial](container-registry-tutorial-quick-task.md), or [Quickstart: Create a container registry using the Azure CLI](container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md).

## Overview of ACR Tasks

A task defines the properties of an automated build, including the location of the container image source code and the event that triggers the build. When an event defined in the task occurs, such as a commit to a Git repository, ACR Tasks initiates a container image build in the cloud. By default, it then pushes a successfully built image to the Azure container registry specified in the task.

ACR Tasks currently support the following triggers:

* Commit to a Git repository
* Base image update

In this tutorial, your ACR task builds and pushes a single container image specified in a Dockerfile. ACR Tasks can also run [multi-step tasks](container-registry-tasks-multi-step.md), using a YAML file to define steps to build, push, and optionally test multiple containers.

## Create a build task

In this section, you first create a GitHub personal access token (PAT) for use with ACR Tasks. Then, you create a task that triggers a build when code is committed to your fork of the repository.

### Create a GitHub personal access token

To trigger a build on a commit to a Git repository, ACR Tasks need a personal access token (PAT) to access the repository. Follow these steps to generate a PAT in GitHub:

1. Navigate to the PAT creation page on GitHub at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
1. Enter a short **description** for the token, for example, "ACR Tasks Demo"
1. Under **repo**, enable **repo:status** and **public_repo**

   ![Screenshot of the Personal Access Token generation page in GitHub][build-task-01-new-token]

1. Select the **Generate token** button (you may be asked to confirm your password)
1. Copy and save the generated token in a **secure location** (you use this token when you define a task in the following section)

   ![Screenshot of the generated Personal Access Token in GitHub][build-task-02-generated-token]

### Create the build task

Now that you've completed the steps required to enable ACR Tasks to read commit status and create webhooks in a repository, you can create a task that triggers a container image build on commits to the repo.

First, populate these shell environment variables with values appropriate for your environment. This step isn't strictly required, but makes executing the multiline Azure CLI commands in this tutorial a bit easier. If you don't populate these environment variables, you must manually replace each value wherever they appear in the example commands.

```azurecli-interactive
ACR_NAME=<registry-name>        # The name of your Azure container registry
GIT_USER=<github-username>      # Your GitHub user account name
GIT_PAT=<personal-access-token> # The PAT you generated in the previous section
```

Now, create the task by executing following [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task create \
    --registry $ACR_NAME \
    --name taskhelloworld \
    --image helloworld:{{.Run.ID}} \
    --context https://github.com/$GIT_USER/acr-build-helloworld-node.git \
    --branch master \
    --file Dockerfile \
    --git-access-token $GIT_PAT
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you previously created tasks during the preview with the `az acr build-task` command, those tasks need to be re-created using the [az acr task][az-acr-task] command.

This task specifies that any time code is committed to the *master* branch in the repository specified by `--context`, ACR Tasks will build the container image from the code in that branch. The Dockerfile specified by `--file` from the repository root is used to build the image. The `--image` argument specifies a parameterized value of `{{.Run.ID}}` for the version portion of the image's tag, ensuring the built image correlates to a specific build, and is tagged uniquely.

Output from a successful [az acr task create][az-acr-task-create] command is similar to the following:

```console
$ az acr task create \
>     --registry $ACR_NAME \
>     --name taskhelloworld \
>     --image helloworld:{{.Run.ID}} \
>     --context https://github.com/$GIT_USER/acr-build-helloworld-node.git \
>     --branch master \
>     --file Dockerfile \
>     --git-access-token $GIT_PAT

## Test the build task

You now have a task that defines your build. To test the build pipeline, trigger a build manually by executing the [az acr task run][az-acr-task-run] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task run --registry $ACR_NAME --name taskhelloworld
```

By default, the `az acr task run` command streams the log output to your console when you execute the command.

```console
$ az acr task run --registry $ACR_NAME --name taskhelloworld

```

## Trigger a build with a commit

Now that you've tested the task by manually running it, trigger it automatically with a source code change.

First, ensure you're in the directory containing your local clone of the [repository][sample-repo]:

```azurecli-interactive
cd acr-build-helloworld-node
```

Next, execute the following commands to create, commit, and push a new file to your fork of the repo on GitHub:

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Hello World!" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Testing ACR Tasks"
git push origin master
```

You may be asked to provide your GitHub credentials when you execute the `git push` command. Provide your GitHub username, and enter the personal access token (PAT) that you created earlier for the password.

```console
$ git push origin master
Username for 'https://github.com': <github-username>
Password for 'https://githubuser@github.com': <personal-access-token>
```

Once you've pushed a commit to your repository, the webhook created by ACR Tasks fires and kicks off a build in Azure Container Registry. Display the logs for the currently running task to verify and monitor the build progress:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task logs --registry $ACR_NAME
```

Output is similar to the following, showing the currently executing (or last-executed) task:

```console
$ az acr task logs --registry $ACR_NAME
Showing logs of the last created run.
Run ID: da4

[...]

Run ID: da4 was successful after 38s
```

## List builds

To see a list of the task runs that ACR Tasks has completed for your registry, run the [az acr task list-runs][az-acr-task-list-runs] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr task list-runs --registry $ACR_NAME --output table
```

Output from the command should appear similar to the following. The runs that ACR Tasks has executed are displayed, and "Git Commit" appears in the TRIGGER column for the most recent task:

```console
$ az acr task list-runs --registry $ACR_NAME --output table

RUN ID    TASK             PLATFORM    STATUS     TRIGGER     STARTED               DURATION
--------  --------------  ----------  ---------  ----------  --------------------  ----------

```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to use a task to automatically trigger container image builds in Azure when you commit source code to a Git repository. Move on to the next tutorial to learn how to create tasks that trigger builds when a container image's base image is updated.
