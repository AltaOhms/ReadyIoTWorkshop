# Azure Container Registry webhook reference

You can [configure webhooks](container-registry-webhook.md) for your container registry that generate events when certain actions are performed against it. For example, enable webhooks that are triggered when a container image or Helm chart is pushed to a registry, or deleted. When a webhook is triggered, Azure Container Registry issues an HTTP or HTTPS request containing information about the event to an endpoint you specify. Your endpoint can then process the webhook and act accordingly.

The following sections detail the schema of webhook requests generated by supported events. The event sections contain the payload schema for the event type, an example request payload, and one or more example commands that would trigger the webhook.

For information about configuring webhooks for your Azure container registry, see [Using Azure Container Registry webhooks](container-registry-webhook.md).

## Webhook requests

### HTTP request

A triggered webhook makes an HTTP `POST` request to the URL endpoint you specified when you configured the webhook.

### HTTP headers

Webhook requests include a `Content-Type` of `application/json` if you have not specified a `Content-Type` custom header for your webhook.

No other headers are added to the request beyond those custom headers you might have specified for the webhook.

## Push event

Webhook triggered when a container image is pushed to a repository.
