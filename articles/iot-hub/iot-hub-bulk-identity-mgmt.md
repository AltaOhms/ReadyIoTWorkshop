# Import and export IoT Hub device identities in bulk

Each IoT hub has an identity registry you can use to create per-device resources in the service. The identity registry also enables you to control access to the device-facing endpoints. This article describes how to import and export device identities in bulk to and from an identity registry.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-whole.md)]

Import and export operations take place in the context of *Jobs* that enable you to execute bulk service operations against an IoT hub.

The **RegistryManager** class includes the **ExportDevicesAsync** and **ImportDevicesAsync** methods that use the **Job** framework. These methods enable you to export, import, and synchronize the entirety of an IoT hub identity registry.

This topic discusses using the **RegistryManager** class and **Job** system to perform bulk imports and exports of devices to and from an IoT hubâ€™s identity registry. You can also use the Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service to enable zero-touch, just-in-time provisioning to one or more IoT hubs without requiring human intervention. To learn more, see the [provisioning service documentation](/azure/iot-dps).


## What are jobs?

Identity registry operations use the **Job** system when the operation:

* Has a potentially long execution time compared to standard run-time operations.

* Returns a large amount of data to the user.

Instead of a single API call waiting or blocking on the result of the operation, the operation asynchronously creates a **Job** for that IoT hub. The operation then immediately returns a **JobProperties** object.

The following C# code snippet shows how to create an export job:

```csharp
// Call an export job on the IoT Hub to retrieve all devices
JobProperties exportJob = await 
  registryManager.ExportDevicesAsync(containerSasUri, false);
```

> [!NOTE]
> To use the **RegistryManager** class in your C# code, add the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** NuGet package to your project. The **RegistryManager** class is in the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** namespace.

You can use the **RegistryManager** class to query the state of the **Job** using the returned **JobProperties** metadata. To create an instance of the **RegistryManager** class, use the **CreateFromConnectionString** method.

```csharp
RegistryManager registryManager =
  RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString("{your IoT Hub connection string}");
```

To find the connection string for your IoT hub, in the Azure portal:

- Navigate to your IoT hub.

- Select **Shared access policies**.

- Select a policy, taking into account the permissions you need.

- Copy the connectionstring from the panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

The following C# code snippet shows how to poll every five seconds to see if the job has finished executing:

```csharp
// Wait until job is finished
while(true)
{
  exportJob = await registryManager.GetJobAsync(exportJob.JobId);
  if (exportJob.Status == JobStatus.Completed || 
      exportJob.Status == JobStatus.Failed ||
      exportJob.Status == JobStatus.Cancelled)
  {
    // Job has finished executing
    break;
  }

  await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
}
```

## Export devices

Use the **ExportDevicesAsync** method to export the entirety of an IoT hub identity registry to an [Azure Storage](../storage/index.yml) blob container using a [Shared Access Signature](../storage/common/storage-security-guide.md#data-plane-security).

This method enables you to create reliable backups of your device information in a blob container that you control.

The **ExportDevicesAsync** method requires two parameters:

* A *string* that contains a URI of a blob container. This URI must contain a SAS token that grants write access to the container. The job creates a block blob in this container to store the serialized export device data. The SAS token must include these permissions:

   ```csharp
   SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Write | SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read 
     | SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Delete
   ```

* A *boolean* that indicates if you want to exclude authentication keys from your export data. If **false**, authentication keys are included in export output. Otherwise, keys are exported as **null**.

The following C# code snippet shows how to initiate an export job that includes device authentication keys in the export data and then poll for completion:

```csharp
// Call an export job on the IoT Hub to retrieve all devices
JobProperties exportJob = 
  await registryManager.ExportDevicesAsync(containerSasUri, false);

// Wait until job is finished
while(true)
{
    exportJob = await registryManager.GetJobAsync(exportJob.JobId);
    if (exportJob.Status == JobStatus.Completed || 
        exportJob.Status == JobStatus.Failed ||
        exportJob.Status == JobStatus.Cancelled)
    {
    // Job has finished executing
    break;
    }

    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
}
```

The job stores its output in the provided blob container as a block blob with the name **devices.txt**. The output data consists of JSON serialized device data, with one device per line.

The following example shows the output data:

```json
{"id":"Device1","eTag":"MA==","status":"enabled","authentication":{"symmetricKey":{"primaryKey":"abc=","secondaryKey":"def="}}}
{"id":"Device2","eTag":"MA==","status":"enabled","authentication":{"symmetricKey":{"primaryKey":"abc=","secondaryKey":"def="}}}
{"id":"Device3","eTag":"MA==","status":"disabled","authentication":{"symmetricKey":{"primaryKey":"abc=","secondaryKey":"def="}}}
{"id":"Device4","eTag":"MA==","status":"disabled","authentication":{"symmetricKey":{"primaryKey":"abc=","secondaryKey":"def="}}}
{"id":"Device5","eTag":"MA==","status":"enabled","authentication":{"symmetricKey":{"primaryKey":"abc=","secondaryKey":"def="}}}
```

If a device has twin data, then the twin data is also exported together with the device data. The following example shows this format. All data from the "twinETag" line until the end is twin data.

```json
{
   "id":"export-6d84f075-0",
   "eTag":"MQ==",
   "status":"enabled",
   "statusReason":"firstUpdate",
   "authentication":null,
   "twinETag":"AAAAAAAAAAI=",
   "tags":{
      "Location":"LivingRoom"
   },
   "properties":{
      "desired":{
         "Thermostat":{
            "Temperature":75.1,
            "Unit":"F"
         },
         "$metadata":{
            "$lastUpdated":"2017-03-09T18:30:52.3167248Z",
            "$lastUpdatedVersion":2,
            "Thermostat":{
               "$lastUpdated":"2017-03-09T18:30:52.3167248Z",
               "$lastUpdatedVersion":2,
               "Temperature":{
                  "$lastUpdated":"2017-03-09T18:30:52.3167248Z",
                  "$lastUpdatedVersion":2
               },
               "Unit":{
                  "$lastUpdated":"2017-03-09T18:30:52.3167248Z",
                  "$lastUpdatedVersion":2
               }
            }
         },
         "$version":2
      },
      "reported":{
         "$metadata":{
            "$lastUpdated":"2017-03-09T18:30:51.1309437Z"
         },
         "$version":1
      }
   }
}
```

If you need access to this data in code, you can easily deserialize this data using the **ExportImportDevice** class. The following C# code snippet shows how to read device information that was previously exported to a block blob:

```csharp
var exportedDevices = new List<ExportImportDevice>();

using (var streamReader = new StreamReader(await blob.OpenReadAsync(AccessCondition.GenerateIfExistsCondition(), null, null), Encoding.UTF8))
{
  while (streamReader.Peek() != -1)
  {
    string line = await streamReader.ReadLineAsync();
    var device = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ExportImportDevice>(line);
    exportedDevices.Add(device);
  }
}
```

## Import devices

The **ImportDevicesAsync** method in the **RegistryManager** class enables you to perform bulk import and synchronization operations in an IoT hub identity registry. Like the **ExportDevicesAsync** method, the **ImportDevicesAsync** method uses the **Job** framework.

Take care using the **ImportDevicesAsync** method because in addition to provisioning new devices in your identity registry, it can also update and delete existing devices.

> [!WARNING]
> An import operation cannot be undone. Always back up your existing data using the **ExportDevicesAsync** method to another blob container before you make bulk changes to your identity registry.

The **ImportDevicesAsync** method takes two parameters:

* A *string* that contains a URI of an [Azure Storage](../storage/index.yml) blob container to use as *input* to the job. This URI must contain a SAS token that grants read access to the container. This container must contain a blob with the name **devices.txt** that contains the serialized device data to import into your identity registry. The import data must contain device information in the same JSON format that the **ExportImportDevice** job uses when it creates a **devices.txt** blob. The SAS token must include these permissions:

   ```csharp
   SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read
   ```

* A *string* that contains a URI of an [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/storage/) blob container to use as *output* from the job. The job creates a block blob in this container to store any error information from the completed import **Job**. The SAS token must include these permissions:

   ```csharp
   SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Write | SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read 
     | SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Delete
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> The two parameters can point to the same blob container. The separate parameters simply enable more control over your data as the output container requires additional permissions.

The following C# code snippet shows how to initiate an import job:

```csharp
JobProperties importJob = 
   await registryManager.ImportDevicesAsync(containerSasUri, containerSasUri);
```

This method can also be used to import the data for the device twin. The format for the data input is the same as the format shown in the **ExportDevicesAsync** section. In this way, you can reimport the exported data. The **$metadata** is optional.

## Import behavior

You can use the **ImportDevicesAsync** method to perform the following bulk operations in your identity registry:

* Bulk registration of new devices
* Bulk deletions of existing devices
* Bulk status changes (enable or disable devices)
* Bulk assignment of new device authentication keys
* Bulk auto-regeneration of device authentication keys
* Bulk update of twin data

You can perform any combination of the preceding operations within a single **ImportDevicesAsync** call. For example, you can register new devices and delete or update existing devices at the same time. When used along with the **ExportDevicesAsync** method, you can completely migrate all your devices from one IoT hub to another.

If the import file includes twin metadata, then this metadata overwrites the existing twin metadata. If the import file does not include twin metadata, then only the `lastUpdateTime` metadata is updated using the current time.

Use the optional **importMode** property in the import serialization data for each device to control the import process per-device. The **importMode** property has the following options:

| importMode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **createOrUpdate** |If a device does not exist with the specified **ID**, it is newly registered. <br/>If the device already exists, existing information is overwritten with the provided input data without regard to the **ETag** value. <br> The user can optionally specify twin data along with the device data. The twinâ€™s etag, if specified, is processed independently from the deviceâ€™s etag. If there is a mismatch with the existing twinâ€™s etag, an error is written to the log file. |
| **create** |If a device does not exist with the specified **ID**, it is newly registered. <br/>If the device already exists, an error is written to the log file. <br> The user can optionally specify twin data along with the device data. The twinâ€™s etag, if specified, is processed independently from the deviceâ€™s etag. If there is a mismatch with the existing twinâ€™s etag, an error is written to the log file. |
| **update** |If a device already exists with the specified **ID**, existing information is overwritten with the provided input data without regard to the **ETag** value. <br/>If the device does not exist, an error is written to the log file. |
| **updateIfMatchETag** |If a device already exists with the specified **ID**, existing information is overwritten with the provided input data only if there is an **ETag** match. <br/>If the device does not exist, an error is written to the log file. <br/>If there is an **ETag** mismatch, an error is written to the log file. |
| **createOrUpdateIfMatchETag** |If a device does not exist with the specified **ID**, it is newly registered. <br/>If the device already exists, existing information is overwritten with the provided input data only if there is an **ETag** match. <br/>If there is an **ETag** mismatch, an error is written to the log file. <br> The user can optionally specify twin data along with the device data. The twinâ€™s etag, if specified, is processed independently from the deviceâ€™s etag. If there is a mismatch with the existing twinâ€™s etag, an error is written to the log file. |
| **delete** |If a device already exists with the specified **ID**, it is deleted without regard to the **ETag** value. <br/>If the device does not exist, an error is written to the log file. |
| **deleteIfMatchETag** |If a device already exists with the specified **ID**, it is deleted only if there is an **ETag** match. If the device does not exist, an error is written to the log file. <br/>If there is an ETag mismatch, an error is written to the log file. |

> [!NOTE]
> If the serialization data does not explicitly define an **importMode** flag for a device, it defaults to **createOrUpdate** during the import operation.

## Import devices example â€“ bulk device provisioning

The following C# code sample illustrates how to generate multiple device identities that:

* Include authentication keys.
* Write that device information to a block blob.
* Import the devices into the identity registry.

```csharp
// Provision 1,000 more devices
var serializedDevices = new List<string>();

for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
  // Create a new ExportImportDevice
  // CryptoKeyGenerator is in the Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Common namespace
  var deviceToAdd = new ExportImportDevice()
  {
    Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    Status = DeviceStatus.Enabled,
    Authentication = new AuthenticationMechanism()
    {
      SymmetricKey = new SymmetricKey()
      {
        PrimaryKey = CryptoKeyGenerator.GenerateKey(32),
        SecondaryKey = CryptoKeyGenerator.GenerateKey(32)
      }
    },
    ImportMode = ImportMode.Create
  };

  // Add device to the list
  serializedDevices.Add(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(deviceToAdd));
}

// Write the list to the blob
var sb = new StringBuilder();
serializedDevices.ForEach(serializedDevice => sb.AppendLine(serializedDevice));
await blob.DeleteIfExistsAsync();

using (CloudBlobStream stream = await blob.OpenWriteAsync())
{
  byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sb.ToString());
  for (var i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i += 500)
  {
    int length = Math.Min(bytes.Length - i, 500);
    await stream.WriteAsync(bytes, i, length);
  }
}

// Call import using the blob to add new devices
// Log information related to the job is written to the same container
// This normally takes 1 minute per 100 devices
JobProperties importJob =
   await registryManager.ImportDevicesAsync(containerSasUri, containerSasUri);

// Wait until job is finished
while(true)
{
  importJob = await registryManager.GetJobAsync(importJob.JobId);
  if (importJob.Status == JobStatus.Completed || 
      importJob.Status == JobStatus.Failed ||
      importJob.Status == JobStatus.Cancelled)
  {
    // Job has finished executing
    break;
  }

  await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
}
```

## Import devices example â€“ bulk deletion

The following code sample shows you how to delete the devices you added using the previous code sample:

```csharp
// Step 1: Update each device's ImportMode to be Delete
sb = new StringBuilder();
serializedDevices.ForEach(serializedDevice =>
{
  // Deserialize back to an ExportImportDevice
  var device = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<ExportImportDevice>(serializedDevice);

  // Update property
  device.ImportMode = ImportMode.Delete;

  // Re-serialize
  sb.AppendLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(device));
});

// Step 2: Write the new import data back to the block blob
await blob.DeleteIfExistsAsync();
using (CloudBlobStream stream = await blob.OpenWriteAsync())
{
  byte[] bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sb.ToString());
  for (var i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i += 500)
  {
    int length = Math.Min(bytes.Length - i, 500);
    await stream.WriteAsync(bytes, i, length);
  }
}

// Step 3: Call import using the same blob to delete all devices
importJob = await registryManager.ImportDevicesAsync(containerSasUri, containerSasUri);

// Wait until job is finished
while(true)
{
  importJob = await registryManager.GetJobAsync(importJob.JobId);
  if (importJob.Status == JobStatus.Completed || 
      importJob.Status == JobStatus.Failed ||
      importJob.Status == JobStatus.Cancelled)
  {
    // Job has finished executing
    break;
  }

  await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
}
```

## Get the container SAS URI

The following code sample shows you how to generate a [SAS URI](../storage/blobs/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-2.md) with read, write, and delete permissions for a blob container:

```csharp
static string GetContainerSasUri(CloudBlobContainer container)
{
  // Set the expiry time and permissions for the container.
  // In this case no start time is specified, so the
  // shared access signature becomes valid immediately.
  var sasConstraints = new SharedAccessBlobPolicy();
  sasConstraints.SharedAccessExpiryTime = DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(24);
  sasConstraints.Permissions = 
    SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Write | 
    SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Read | 
    SharedAccessBlobPermissions.Delete;

  // Generate the shared access signature on the container,
  // setting the constraints directly on the signature.
  string sasContainerToken = container.GetSharedAccessSignature(sasConstraints);

  // Return the URI string for the container,
  // including the SAS token.
  return container.Uri + sasContainerToken;
}
```
