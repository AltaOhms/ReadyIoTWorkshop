# Send messages from the cloud to your device with IoT Hub (.NET)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-c2d](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-c2d.md)]

## Introduction

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that helps enable reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of devices and a solution back end. [Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub...](quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md) shows how to create an IoT hub, provision a device identity in it, and code a device app that sends device-to-cloud messages.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-whole.md)]

This tutorial builds on the quickstart [Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub...](quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md). It shows you how to do the following steps:

* From your solution back end, send cloud-to-device messages to a single device through IoT Hub.

* Receive cloud-to-device messages on a device.

* From your solution back end, request delivery acknowledgement (*feedback*) for messages sent to a device from IoT Hub.

You can find more information on cloud-to-device messages in [D2C and C2D Messaging with IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-messaging.md).

At the end of this tutorial, you run two .NET console apps.

* **SimulatedDevice**, a modified version of the app created in [Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub...](quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md), which connects to your IoT hub and receives cloud-to-device messages.

* **SendCloudToDevice**, which sends a cloud-to-device message to the device app through IoT Hub, and then receives its delivery acknowledgement.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub has SDK support for many device platforms and languages (including C, Java, and Javascript) through [Azure IoT device SDKs](iot-hub-devguide-sdks.md). For step-by-step instructions on how to connect your device to this tutorial's code, and generally to Azure IoT Hub, see the [IoT Hub developer guide](iot-hub-devguide.md).

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* Visual Studio 2017

* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.)

## Receive messages in the device app

In this section, you'll modify the device app you created in [Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub...](quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md) to receive cloud-to-device messages from the IoT hub.

1. In Visual Studio, in the **SimulatedDevice** project, add the following method to the **Program** class.

   ```csharp
    private static async void ReceiveC2dAsync()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\nReceiving cloud to device messages from service");
        while (true)
        {
            Message receivedMessage = await s_deviceClient.ReceiveAsync();
            if (receivedMessage == null) continue;

            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine("Received message: {0}", 
            Encoding.ASCII.GetString(receivedMessage.GetBytes()));
            Console.ResetColor();

            await s_deviceClient.CompleteAsync(receivedMessage);
        }
    }
   ```

   The `ReceiveAsync` method asynchronously returns the received message at the time that it is received by the device. It returns *null* after a specifiable timeout period (in this case, the default of one minute is used). When the app receives a *null*, it should continue to wait for new messages. This requirement is the reason for the `if (receivedMessage == null) continue` line.

    The call to `CompleteAsync()` notifies IoT Hub that the message has been successfully processed. The message can be safely removed from the device queue. If something happened that prevented the device app from completing the processing of the message, IoT Hub delivers it again. It is then important that message processing logic in the device app is *idempotent*, so that receiving the same message multiple times produces the same result. 

    An application can also temporarily abandon a message, which results in IoT hub retaining the message in the queue for future consumption. Or the application can reject a message, which permanently removes the message from the queue. For more information about the cloud-to-device message lifecycle, see [D2C and C2D messaging with IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-messaging.md).

   > [!NOTE]
   > When using HTTPS instead of MQTT or AMQP as a transport, the `ReceiveAsync` method returns immediately. The supported pattern for cloud-to-device messages with HTTPS is intermittently connected devices that check for messages infrequently (less than every 25 minutes). Issuing more HTTPS receives results in IoT Hub throttling the requests. For more information about the differences between MQTT, AMQP and HTTPS support, and IoT Hub throttling, see [D2C and C2D messaging with IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-messaging.md).

2. Add the following method in the **Main** method, right before the `Console.ReadLine()` line:

   ```csharp
   ReceiveC2dAsync();
   ```

## Get the IoT Hub connection string

First, retrieve the IoT Hub connection string from the portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups**.

2. Select the Resource group you are using for this how-to.

3. Select the IoT Hub you are using.

4. In the pane for the hub, select **Shared access policies**.

5. Select **iothubowner**. It shows the connection strings on the **iothubowner** panel. Select the copy icon for the **Connection string--primary key**. Save the connection string for later use.

## Send a cloud-to-device message

Now you write a .NET console app that sends cloud-to-device messages to the device app.

1. In the current Visual Studio solution, right-click on the solution and select Add > New Project. Select **Windows Desktop** and then **Console App (.NET Framework)**. Name the project **SendCloudToDevice** and select the most recent version of the .NET Framework, then select **OK** to create the project.

   ![New project in Visual Studio](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-c2d/create-identity-csharp1.png)

2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**.

   This action opens the **Manage NuGet Packages** window.

3. Search for **Microsoft.Azure.Devices**, select the Browse tab. When you find the package, click **Install**, and accept the terms of use.

   This downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT service SDK NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices/).

4. Add the following `using` statement at the top of the **Program.cs** file.

   ``` csharp
   using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
   ```

5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Substitute the placeholder value with the IoT hub connection string you saved previously in this section. 

   ``` csharp
   static ServiceClient serviceClient;
   static string connectionString = "{iot hub connection string}";
   ```

6. Add the following method to the **Program** class. Set the device name to what you used when defining the device in [Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub...](quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md).

   ``` csharp
   private async static Task SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync()
   {
        var commandMessage = new
         Message(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes("Cloud to device message."));
        await serviceClient.SendAsync("myDevice", commandMessage);
   }
   ```

   This method sends a new cloud-to-device message to the device with the ID, `myFirstDevice`. Change this parameter only if you modified it from the one used in [Send telemetry from a device to an IoT hub...](quickstart-send-telemetry-dotnet.md).

7. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method.

   ``` csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Send Cloud-to-Device message\n");
   serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);

   Console.WriteLine("Press any key to send a C2D message.");
   Console.ReadLine();
   SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync().Wait();
   Console.ReadLine();
   ```

8. From within Visual Studio, right-click your solution, and select **Set StartUp projects...**. Select **Multiple startup projects**, then select the **Start** action for **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages**, **SimulatedDevice**, and **SendCloudToDevice**.

9. Press **F5**. All three applications should start. Select the **SendCloudToDevice** windows, and press **Enter**. You should see the message being received by the device app.

## Receive delivery feedback

It is possible to request delivery (or expiration) acknowledgements from IoT Hub for each cloud-to-device message. This option enables the solution back end to easily inform retry or compensation logic. For more information about cloud-to-device feedback, see [D2C and C2D Messaging with IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-messaging.md).

In this section, you modify the **SendCloudToDevice** app to request feedback, and receive it from the IoT hub.

1. In Visual Studio, in the **SendCloudToDevice** project, add the following method to the **Program** class.

   ```csharp
   private async static void ReceiveFeedbackAsync()
   {
        var feedbackReceiver = serviceClient.GetFeedbackReceiver();

        Console.WriteLine("\nReceiving c2d feedback from service");
        while (true)
        {
            var feedbackBatch = await feedbackReceiver.ReceiveAsync();
            if (feedbackBatch == null) continue;

            Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
            Console.WriteLine("Received feedback: {0}",
              string.Join(", ", feedbackBatch.Records.Select(f => f.StatusCode)));
            Console.ResetColor();

            await feedbackReceiver.CompleteAsync(feedbackBatch);
        }
    }
    ```

    Note this receive pattern is the same one used to receive cloud-to-device messages from the device app.

2. Add the following method in the **Main** method, right after the `serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString)` line.

   ``` csharp
   ReceiveFeedbackAsync();
   ```

3. To request feedback for the delivery of your cloud-to-device message, you have to specify a property in the **SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync** method. Add the following line, right after the `var commandMessage = new Message(...);` line.

   ``` csharp
   commandMessage.Ack = DeliveryAcknowledgement.Full;
   ```

4. Run the apps by pressing **F5**. You should see all three applications start. Select the **SendCloudToDevice** windows, and press **Enter**. You should see the message being received by the device app, and after a few seconds, the feedback message being received by your **SendCloudToDevice** application.

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity's sake, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as exponential backoff), as suggested in the article, [Transient Fault Handling](/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults).
