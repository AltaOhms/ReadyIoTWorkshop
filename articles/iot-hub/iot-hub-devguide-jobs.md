# Schedule jobs on multiple devices

Azure IoT Hub enables a number of building blocks like [device twin properties and tags](iot-hub-devguide-device-twins.md) and [direct methods](iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods.md). Typically, back-end apps enable device administrators and operators to update and interact with IoT devices in bulk and at a scheduled time. Jobs execute device twin updates and direct methods against a set of devices at a scheduled time. For example, an operator would use a back-end app that initiates and tracks a job to reboot a set of devices in building 43 and floor 3 at a time that would not be disruptive to the operations of the building.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-whole.md)]

Consider using jobs when you need to schedule and track progress any of the following activities on a set of devices:

* Update desired properties
* Update tags
* Invoke direct methods

## Job lifecycle

Jobs are initiated by the solution back end and maintained by IoT Hub. You can initiate a job through a service-facing URI (`PUT https://<iot hub>/jobs/v2/<jobID>?api-version=2018-06-30`) and query for progress on an executing job through a service-facing URI (`GET https://<iot hub>/jobs/v2/<jobID?api-version=2018-06-30`). To refresh the status of running jobs once a job is initiated, run a job query.

> [!NOTE]
> When you initiate a job, property names and values can only contain US-ASCII printable alphanumeric, except any in the following set: `$ ( ) < > @ , ; : \ " / [ ] ? = { } SP HT`

## Jobs to execute direct methods

The following snippet shows the HTTPS 1.1 request details for executing a [direct method](iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods.md) on a set of devices using a job:

```
PUT /jobs/v2/<jobId>?api-version=2018-06-30

Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Request-Id: <guid>
User-Agent: <sdk-name>/<sdk-version>

{
    "jobId": "<jobId>",
    "type": "scheduleDirectMethod",
    "cloudToDeviceMethod": {
        "methodName": "<methodName>",
        "payload": <payload>,
        "responseTimeoutInSeconds": methodTimeoutInSeconds
    },
    "queryCondition": "<queryOrDevices>", // query condition
    "startTime": <jobStartTime>,          // as an ISO-8601 date string
    "maxExecutionTimeInSeconds": <maxExecutionTimeInSeconds>
}
```

The query condition can also be on a single device ID or on a list of device IDs as shown in the following examples:

```
"queryCondition" = "deviceId = 'MyDevice1'"
"queryCondition" = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1','MyDevice2']"
"queryCondition" = "deviceId IN ['MyDevice1']"
```

[IoT Hub Query Language](iot-hub-devguide-query-language.md) covers IoT Hub query language in additional detail.

## Jobs to update device twin properties

The following snippet shows the HTTPS 1.1 request details for updating device twin properties using a job:

```
PUT /jobs/v2/<jobId>?api-version=2018-06-30

Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Request-Id: <guid>
User-Agent: <sdk-name>/<sdk-version>

{
    "jobId": "<jobId>",
    "type": "scheduleTwinUpdate",
    "updateTwin": <patch>                 // Valid JSON object
    "queryCondition": "<queryOrDevices>", // query condition
    "startTime": <jobStartTime>,          // as an ISO-8601 date string
    "maxExecutionTimeInSeconds": <maxExecutionTimeInSeconds>
}
```

## Querying for progress on jobs

The following snippet shows the HTTPS 1.1 request details for querying for jobs:

```
GET /jobs/v2/query?api-version=2018-06-30[&jobType=<jobType>][&jobStatus=<jobStatus>][&pageSize=<pageSize>][&continuationToken=<continuationToken>]

Authorization: <config.sharedAccessSignature>
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Request-Id: <guid>
User-Agent: <sdk-name>/<sdk-version>
```

The continuationToken is provided from the response.

You can query for the job execution status on each device using the [IoT Hub query language for device twins, jobs, and message routing](iot-hub-devguide-query-language.md).

## Jobs Properties

The following list shows the properties and corresponding descriptions, which can be used when querying for jobs or job results.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **jobId** |Application provided ID for the job. |
| **startTime** |Application provided start time (ISO-8601) for the job. |
| **endTime** |IoT Hub provided date (ISO-8601) for when the job completed. Valid only after the job reaches the 'completed' state. |
| **type** |Types of jobs: |
| | **scheduledUpdateTwin**: A job used to update a set of desired properties or tags. |
| | **scheduledDeviceMethod**: A job used to invoke a device method on a set of device twins. |
| **status** |Current state of the job. Possible values for status: |
| | **pending**: Scheduled and waiting to be picked up by the job service. |
| | **scheduled**: Scheduled for a time in the future. |
| | **running**: Currently active job. |
| | **canceled**: Job has been canceled. |
| | **failed**: Job failed. |
| | **completed**: Job has completed. |
| **deviceJobStatistics** |Statistics about the job's execution. |
| | **deviceJobStatistics** properties: |
| | **deviceJobStatistics.deviceCount**: Number of devices in the job. |
| | **deviceJobStatistics.failedCount**: Number of devices where the job failed. |
| | **deviceJobStatistics.succeededCount**: Number of devices where the job succeeded. |
| | **deviceJobStatistics.runningCount**: Number of devices that are currently running the job. |
| | **deviceJobStatistics.pendingCount**: Number of devices that are pending to run the job. |
