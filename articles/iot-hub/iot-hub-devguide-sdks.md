# Understand and use Azure IoT Hub SDKs

There are two categories of software development kits (SDKs) for working with IoT Hub:

* **IoT Hub Device SDKs** enable you to build apps that run on your IoT devices using device client or module client. These apps send telemetry to your IoT hub, and optionally receive messages, job, method, or twin updates from your IoT hub.  You can also use module client to author [modules](../iot-edge/iot-edge-modules.md) for [Azure IoT Edge runtime](../iot-edge/about-iot-edge.md).

* **IoT Hub Service SDKs** enable you to build backend applications to manage your IoT hub, and optionally send messages, schedule jobs, invoke direct methods, or send desired property updates to your IoT devices or modules.

In addition, we also provide a set of SDKs for working with the [Device Provisioning Service](../iot-dps/about-iot-dps.md).
* **Provisioning Device SDKs** enable you to build apps that run on your IoT devices to communicate with the Device Provisioning Service.

* **Provisioning Service SDKs** enable you to build backend applications to manage your enrollments in the Device Provisioning Service.

### OS platform and hardware compatibility

Supported platforms for the SDKs can be found in [Azure IoT SDKs Platform Support](iot-hub-device-sdk-platform-support.md).

For more information about SDK compatibility with specific hardware devices, see the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/) or individual repository.
