# Azure IoT device SDK for C

The **Azure IoT device SDK** is a set of libraries designed to simplify the process of sending messages to and receiving messages from the **Azure IoT Hub** service. There are different variations of the SDK, each targeting a specific platform, but this article describes the **Azure IoT device SDK for C**.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-partial.md)]

The Azure IoT device SDK for C is written in ANSI C (C99) to maximize portability. This feature makes the libraries well-suited to operate on multiple platforms and devices, especially where minimizing disk and memory footprint is a priority.

There are a broad range of platforms on which the SDK has been tested (see the [Azure Certified for IoT device catalog](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/) for details). Although this article includes walkthroughs of sample code running on the Windows platform, the code described in this article is identical across the range of supported platforms.

The following video presents an overview of the Azure IoT SDK for C:

>[!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/Azure-IoT-C-SDK-insights/Player]

This article introduces you to the architecture of the Azure IoT device SDK for C. It demonstrates how to initialize the device library, send data to IoT Hub, and receive messages from it. The information in this article should be enough to get started using the SDK, but also provides pointers to additional information about the libraries.

## SDK architecture

You can find the [**Azure IoT device SDK for C**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository and view details of the API in the [C API reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-c-sdk-ref/).

The latest version of the libraries can be found in the **master** branch of the repository:

  ![Screenshot of the master branch of the repository](./media/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/RepoMasterBranch.png)

* The core implementation of the SDK is in the **iothub\_client** folder that contains the implementation of the lowest API layer in the SDK: the **IoTHubClient** library. The **IoTHubClient** library contains APIs implementing raw messaging for sending messages to IoT Hub and receiving messages from IoT Hub. When using this library, you are responsible for implementing message serialization, but other details of communicating with IoT Hub are handled for you.

* The **serializer** folder contains helper functions and samples that show you how to serialize data before sending to Azure IoT Hub using the client library. The use of the serializer is not mandatory and is provided as a convenience. To use the **serializer** library, you define a model that specifies the data to send to IoT Hub and the messages you expect to receive from it. Once the model is defined, the SDK provides you with an API surface that enables you to easily work with device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messages without worrying about the serialization details. The library depends on other open source libraries that implement transport using protocols such as MQTT and AMQP.

* The **IoTHubClient** library depends on other open source libraries:

  * The [Azure C shared utility](https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility) library, which provides common functionality for basic tasks (such as strings, list manipulation, and IO) needed across several Azure-related C SDKs.

  * The [Azure uAMQP](https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-c) library, which is a client-side implementation of AMQP optimized for resource constrained devices.

  * The [Azure uMQTT](https://github.com/Azure/azure-umqtt-c) library, which is a general-purpose library implementing the MQTT protocol and optimized for resource constrained devices.

Use of these libraries is easier to understand by looking at example code. The following sections walk you through several of the sample applications that are included in the SDK. This walkthrough should give you a good feel for the various capabilities of the architectural layers of the SDK and an introduction to how the APIs work.

## Before you run the samples

Before you can run the samples in the Azure IoT device SDK for C, you must [create an instance of the IoT Hub service](iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in your Azure subscription. Then complete the following tasks:

* Prepare your development environment
* Obtain device credentials.

### Prepare your development environment

Packages are provided for common platforms (such as NuGet for Windows or apt_get for Debian and Ubuntu) and the samples use these packages when available. In some cases, you need to compile the SDK for or on your device. If you need to compile the SDK, see [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/doc/devbox_setup.md) in the GitHub repository.

To obtain the sample application code, download a copy of the SDK from GitHub. Get your copy of the source from the **master** branch of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c).


### Obtain the device credentials

Now that you have the sample source code, the next thing to do is to get a set of device credentials. For a device to be able to access an IoT hub, you must first add the device to the IoT Hub identity registry. When you add your device, you get a set of device credentials that you need for the device to be able to connect to the IoT hub. The sample applications discussed in the next section expect these credentials in the form of a **device connection string**.

There are several open source tools to help you manage your IoT hub.

* A Windows application called [device explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/master/tools/DeviceExplorer).

* A cross-platform Visual Studio Code extension called [Azure IoT Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-tools).

* A cross-platform Python CLI called [the IoT extension for Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-cli-extension).

This tutorial uses the graphical *device explorer* tool. You can use the *Azure IoT Tools for VS Code* if you develop in VS Code. You can also use the *the IoT extension for Azure CLI 2.0* tool if you prefer to use a CLI tool.

The device explorer tool uses the Azure IoT service libraries to perform various functions on IoT Hub, including adding devices. If you use the device explorer tool to add a device, you get a connection string for your device. You need this connection string to run the sample applications.

If you're not familiar with the device explorer tool, the following procedure describes how to use it to add a device and obtain a device connection string.

1. To install the device explorer tool, see [How to use the Device Explorer for IoT Hub devices](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/tree/master/tools/DeviceExplorer).

1. When you run the program, you see this interface:

   ![Device Explorer Twin screenshot](./media/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/DeviceExplorerTwinConfigTab.png)

1. Enter your **IoT Hub Connection String** in the first field and click **Update**. This step configures the tool so that it can communicate with IoT Hub. 

The **Connection String** can be found under **IoT Hub Service** > **Settings** > **Shared Access Policy** > **iothubowner**.

1. When the IoT Hub connection string is configured, click the **Management** tab:

   ![Device Explorer Twin / Management screenshot](./media/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/DeviceExplorerTwinManagementTab.png)

This tab is where you manage the devices registered in your IoT hub.

1. You create a device by clicking the **Create** button. A dialog displays with a set of pre-populated keys (primary and secondary). Enter a **Device ID** and then click **Create**.

   ![Create Device screenshot](./media/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/CreateDevice.png)

1. When the device is created, the Devices list updates with all the registered devices, including the one you just created. If you right-click your new device, you see this menu:

   ![Device Explorer Twin right-click result](./media/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/DeviceExplorerTwinManagementTab_RightClick.png)

1. If you choose **Copy connection string for selected device**, the device connection string is copied to the clipboard. Keep a copy of the device connection string. You need it when running the sample applications described in the following sections.

When you've completed the steps above, you're ready to start running some code. Most samples have a constant at the top of the main source file that enables you to enter a connection string. For example, the corresponding line from the **iothub_client\_samples\_iothub_convenience_sample** application appears as follows.

```c
static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
```

## Use the IoTHubClient library

Within the **iothub\_client** folder in the [azure-iot-sdk-c](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) repository, there is a **samples** folder that contains an application called **iothub\_client\_sample\_mqtt**.

The Windows version of the **iothub_client\_samples\_iothub_convenience_sample** application includes the following Visual Studio solution:

  ![Visual Studio Solution Explorer](./media/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/iothub-client-sample-mqtt.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you open this project in Visual Studio 2017, accept the prompts to retarget the project to the latest version.

This solution contains a single project. There are four NuGet packages installed in this solution:

* Microsoft.Azure.C.SharedUtility
* Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.MqttTransport
* Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.IoTHubClient
* Microsoft.Azure.umqtt

You always need the **Microsoft.Azure.C.SharedUtility** package when you are working with the SDK. This sample uses the MQTT protocol, therefore you must include the **Microsoft.Azure.umqtt** and **Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.MqttTransport** packages (there are equivalent packages for AMQP and HTTPS). Because the sample uses the **IoTHubClient** library, you must also include the **Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.IoTHubClient** package in your solution.

You can find the implementation for the sample application in the **iothub_client\_samples\_iothub_convenience_sample** source file.

The following steps use this sample application to walk you through what's required to use the **IoTHubClient** library.

### Initialize the library

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start working with the libraries, you may need to perform some platform-specific initialization. For example, if you plan to use AMQP on Linux you must initialize the OpenSSL library. The samples in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) call the utility function **platform\_init** when the client starts and call the **platform\_deinit** function before exiting. These functions are declared in the platform.h header file. Examine the definitions of these functions for your target platform in the [repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) to determine whether you need to include any platform-specific initialization code in your client.

To start working with the libraries, first allocate an IoT Hub client handle:

```c
if ((iotHubClientHandle = 
  IoTHubClient_LL_CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, MQTT_Protocol)) == NULL)
{
    (void)printf("ERROR: iotHubClientHandle is NULL!\r\n");
}
else
{
    ...
```

You pass a copy of the device connection string you obtained from the device explorer tool to this function. You also designate the communications protocol to use. This example uses MQTT, but AMQP and HTTPS are also options.

When you have a valid **IOTHUB\_CLIENT\_HANDLE**, you can start calling the APIs to send and receive messages to and from IoT Hub.

### Send messages

The sample application sets up a loop to send messages to your IoT hub. The following snippet:

- Creates a message.
- Adds a property to the message.
- Sends a message.

First, create a message:

```c
size_t iterator = 0;
do
{
    if (iterator < MESSAGE_COUNT)
    {
        sprintf_s(msgText, sizeof(msgText), "{\"deviceId\":\"myFirstDevice\",\"windSpeed\":%.2f}", avgWindSpeed + (rand() % 4 + 2));
        if ((messages[iterator].messageHandle = IoTHubMessage_CreateFromByteArray((const unsigned char*)msgText, strlen(msgText))) == NULL)
        {
            (void)printf("ERROR: iotHubMessageHandle is NULL!\r\n");
        }
        else
        {
            messages[iterator].messageTrackingId = iterator;
            MAP_HANDLE propMap = IoTHubMessage_Properties(messages[iterator].messageHandle);
            (void)sprintf_s(propText, sizeof(propText), "PropMsg_%zu", iterator);
            if (Map_AddOrUpdate(propMap, "PropName", propText) != MAP_OK)
            {
                (void)printf("ERROR: Map_AddOrUpdate Failed!\r\n");
            }

            if (IoTHubClient_LL_SendEventAsync(iotHubClientHandle, messages[iterator].messageHandle, SendConfirmationCallback, &messages[iterator]) != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK)
            {
                (void)printf("ERROR: IoTHubClient_LL_SendEventAsync..........FAILED!\r\n");
            }
            else
            {
                (void)printf("IoTHubClient_LL_SendEventAsync accepted message [%d] for transmission to IoT Hub.\r\n", (int)iterator);
            }
        }
    }
    IoTHubClient_LL_DoWork(iotHubClientHandle);
    ThreadAPI_Sleep(1);

    iterator++;
} while (g_continueRunning);
```

Every time you send a message, you specify a reference to a callback function that's invoked when the data is sent. In this example, the callback function is called **SendConfirmationCallback**. The following snippet shows this callback function:

```c
static void SendConfirmationCallback(IOTHUB_CLIENT_CONFIRMATION_RESULT result, void* userContextCallback)
{
    EVENT_INSTANCE* eventInstance = (EVENT_INSTANCE*)userContextCallback;
    (void)printf("Confirmation[%d] received for message tracking id = %zu with result = %s\r\n", callbackCounter, eventInstance->messageTrackingId, ENUM_TO_STRING(IOTHUB_CLIENT_CONFIRMATION_RESULT, result));
    /* Some device specific action code goes here... */
    callbackCounter++;
    IoTHubMessage_Destroy(eventInstance->messageHandle);
}
```

Note the call to the **IoTHubMessage\_Destroy** function when you're done with the message. This function frees the resources allocated when you created the message.

### Receive messages

Receiving a message is an asynchronous operation. First, you register the callback to invoke when the device receives a message:

```c
if (IoTHubClient_LL_SetMessageCallback(iotHubClientHandle, ReceiveMessageCallback, &receiveContext) != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK)
{
    (void)printf("ERROR: IoTHubClient_LL_SetMessageCallback..........FAILED!\r\n");
}
else
{
    (void)printf("IoTHubClient_LL_SetMessageCallback...successful.\r\n");
    ...
```

The last parameter is a void pointer to whatever you want. In the sample, it's a pointer to an integer but it could be a pointer to a more complex data structure. This parameter enables the callback function to operate on shared state with the caller of this function.

When the device receives a message, the registered callback function is invoked. This callback function retrieves:

* The message id and correlation id from the message.
* The message content.
* Any custom properties from the message.

```c
static IOTHUBMESSAGE_DISPOSITION_RESULT ReceiveMessageCallback(IOTHUB_MESSAGE_HANDLE message, void* userContextCallback)
{
    int* counter = (int*)userContextCallback;
    const char* buffer;
    size_t size;
    MAP_HANDLE mapProperties;
    const char* messageId;
    const char* correlationId;

    // Message properties
    if ((messageId = IoTHubMessage_GetMessageId(message)) == NULL)
    {
        messageId = "<null>";
    }

    if ((correlationId = IoTHubMessage_GetCorrelationId(message)) == NULL)
    {
        correlationId = "<null>";
    }

    // Message content
    if (IoTHubMessage_GetByteArray(message, (const unsigned char**)&buffer, &size) != IOTHUB_MESSAGE_OK)
    {
        (void)printf("unable to retrieve the message data\r\n");
    }
    else
    {
        (void)printf("Received Message [%d]\r\n Message ID: %s\r\n Correlation ID: %s\r\n Data: <<<%.*s>>> & Size=%d\r\n", *counter, messageId, correlationId, (int)size, buffer, (int)size);
        // If we receive the work 'quit' then we stop running
        if (size == (strlen("quit") * sizeof(char)) && memcmp(buffer, "quit", size) == 0)
        {
            g_continueRunning = false;
        }
    }

    // Retrieve properties from the message
    mapProperties = IoTHubMessage_Properties(message);
    if (mapProperties != NULL)
    {
        const char*const* keys;
        const char*const* values;
        size_t propertyCount = 0;
        if (Map_GetInternals(mapProperties, &keys, &values, &propertyCount) == MAP_OK)
        {
            if (propertyCount > 0)
            {
                size_t index;

                printf(" Message Properties:\r\n");
                for (index = 0; index < propertyCount; index++)
                {
                    (void)printf("\tKey: %s Value: %s\r\n", keys[index], values[index]);
                }
                (void)printf("\r\n");
            }
        }
    }

    /* Some device specific action code goes here... */
    (*counter)++;
    return IOTHUBMESSAGE_ACCEPTED;
}
```

Use the **IoTHubMessage\_GetByteArray** function to retrieve the message, which in this example is a string.

### Uninitialize the library

When you're done sending events and receiving messages, you can uninitialize the IoT library. To do so, issue the following function call:

```c
IoTHubClient_LL_Destroy(iotHubClientHandle);
```

This call frees up the resources previously allocated by the **IoTHubClient\_CreateFromConnectionString** function.

As you can see, it's easy to send and receive messages with the **IoTHubClient** library. The library handles the details of communicating with IoT Hub, including which protocol to use (from the perspective of the developer, this is a simple configuration option).

The **IoTHubClient** library also provides precise control over how to serialize the data your device sends to IoT Hub. In some cases this level of control is an advantage, but in others it is an implementation detail that you don't want to be concerned with. If that's the case, you might consider using the **serializer** library, which is described in the next section.

## Use the serializer library

Conceptually the **serializer** library sits on top of the **IoTHubClient** library in the SDK. It uses the **IoTHubClient** library for the underlying communication with IoT Hub, but it adds modeling capabilities that remove the burden of dealing with message serialization from the developer. How this library works is best demonstrated by an example.

Inside the **serializer** folder in the [azure-iot-sdk-c repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c), is a **samples** folder that contains an application called **simplesample\_mqtt**. The Windows version of this sample includes the following Visual Studio solution:

  ![Visual Studio Solution for mqtt sample](./media/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro/simplesample_mqtt.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you open this project in Visual Studio 2017, accept the prompts to retarget the project to the latest version.

As with the previous sample, this one includes several NuGet packages:

* Microsoft.Azure.C.SharedUtility
* Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.MqttTransport
* Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.IoTHubClient
* Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.Serializer
* Microsoft.Azure.umqtt

You've seen most of these packages in the previous sample, but **Microsoft.Azure.IoTHub.Serializer** is new. This package is required when you use the **serializer** library.

You can find the implementation of the sample application in the **iothub_client\_samples\_iothub_convenience_sample** file.

The following sections walk you through the key parts of this sample.

### Initialize the library

To start working with the **serializer** library, call the initialization APIs:

```c
if (serializer_init(NULL) != SERIALIZER_OK)
{
    (void)printf("Failed on serializer_init\r\n");
}
else
{
    IOTHUB_CLIENT_LL_HANDLE iotHubClientHandle = IoTHubClient_LL_CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, MQTT_Protocol);
    srand((unsigned int)time(NULL));
    int avgWindSpeed = 10;

    if (iotHubClientHandle == NULL)
    {
        (void)printf("Failed on IoTHubClient_LL_Create\r\n");
    }
    else
    {
        ContosoAnemometer* myWeather = CREATE_MODEL_INSTANCE(WeatherStation, ContosoAnemometer);
        if (myWeather == NULL)
        {
            (void)printf("Failed on CREATE_MODEL_INSTANCE\r\n");
        }
        else
        {
...
```

The call to the **serializer\_init** function is a one-time call and initializes the underlying library. Then, you call the **IoTHubClient\_LL\_CreateFromConnectionString** function, which is the same API as in the **IoTHubClient** sample. This call sets your device connection string (this call is also where you choose the protocol you want to use). This sample uses MQTT as the transport, but could use AMQP or HTTPS.

Finally, call the **CREATE\_MODEL\_INSTANCE** function. **WeatherStation** is the namespace of the model and **ContosoAnemometer** is the name of the model. Once the model instance is created, you can use it to start sending and receiving messages. However, it's important to understand what a model is.

### Define the model

A model in the **serializer** library defines the messages that your device can send to IoT Hub and the messages, called *actions* in the modeling language, which it can receive. You define a model using a set of C macros as in the **iothub_client\_samples\_iothub_convenience_sample** sample application:

```c
BEGIN_NAMESPACE(WeatherStation);

DECLARE_MODEL(ContosoAnemometer,
WITH_DATA(ascii_char_ptr, DeviceId),
WITH_DATA(int, WindSpeed),
WITH_ACTION(TurnFanOn),
WITH_ACTION(TurnFanOff),
WITH_ACTION(SetAirResistance, int, Position)
);

END_NAMESPACE(WeatherStation);
```

The **BEGIN\_NAMESPACE** and **END\_NAMESPACE** macros both take the namespace of the model as an argument. It's expected that anything between these macros is the definition of your model or models, and the data structures that the models use.

In this example, there is a single model called **ContosoAnemometer**. This model defines two pieces of data that your device can send to IoT Hub: **DeviceId** and **WindSpeed**. It also defines three actions (messages) that your device can receive: **TurnFanOn**, **TurnFanOff**, and **SetAirResistance**. Each data element has a type, and each action has a name (and optionally a set of parameters).

The data and actions defined in the model define an API surface that you can use to send messages to IoT Hub, and respond to messages sent to the device. Use of this model is best understood through an example.

### Send messages

The model defines the data you can send to IoT Hub. In this example, that means one of the two data items defined using the **WITH_DATA** macro. There are several steps required to send **DeviceId** and **WindSpeed** values to an IoT hub. The first is to set the data you want to send:

```c
myWeather->DeviceId = "myFirstDevice";
myWeather->WindSpeed = avgWindSpeed + (rand() % 4 + 2);
```

The model you defined earlier enables you to set the values by setting members of a **struct**. Next, serialize the message you want to send:

```c
unsigned char* destination;
size_t destinationSize;
if (SERIALIZE(&destination, &destinationSize, myWeather->DeviceId, myWeather->WindSpeed) != CODEFIRST_OK)
{
    (void)printf("Failed to serialize\r\n");
}
else
{
    sendMessage(iotHubClientHandle, destination, destinationSize);
    free(destination);
}
```

This code serializes the device-to-cloud to a buffer (referenced by **destination**). The code then invokes the **sendMessage** function to send the message to IoT Hub:

```c
static void sendMessage(IOTHUB_CLIENT_LL_HANDLE iotHubClientHandle, const unsigned char* buffer, size_t size)
{
    static unsigned int messageTrackingId;
    IOTHUB_MESSAGE_HANDLE messageHandle = IoTHubMessage_CreateFromByteArray(buffer, size);
    if (messageHandle == NULL)
    {
        printf("unable to create a new IoTHubMessage\r\n");
    }
    else
    {
        if (IoTHubClient_LL_SendEventAsync(iotHubClientHandle, messageHandle, sendCallback, (void*)(uintptr_t)messageTrackingId) != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK)
        {
            printf("failed to hand over the message to IoTHubClient");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("IoTHubClient accepted the message for delivery\r\n");
        }
        IoTHubMessage_Destroy(messageHandle);
    }
    messageTrackingId++;
}
```

The second to last parameter of **IoTHubClient\_LL\_SendEventAsync** is a reference to a callback function that's called when the data is successfully sent. Here's the callback function in the sample:

```c
void sendCallback(IOTHUB_CLIENT_CONFIRMATION_RESULT result, void* userContextCallback)
{
    unsigned int messageTrackingId = (unsigned int)(uintptr_t)userContextCallback;

    (void)printf("Message Id: %u Received.\r\n", messageTrackingId);

    (void)printf("Result Call Back Called! Result is: %s \r\n", ENUM_TO_STRING(IOTHUB_CLIENT_CONFIRMATION_RESULT, result));
}
```

The second parameter is a pointer to user context; the same pointer passed to **IoTHubClient\_LL\_SendEventAsync**. In this case, the context is a simple counter, but it can be anything you want.

That's all there is to sending device-to-cloud messages. The only thing left to cover is how to receive messages.

### Receive messages

Receiving a message works similarly to the way messages work in the **IoTHubClient** library. First, you register a message callback function:

```c
if (IoTHubClient_LL_SetMessageCallback(iotHubClientHandle, 
  IoTHubMessage, myWeather) != IOTHUB_CLIENT_OK)
{
    printf("unable to IoTHubClient_SetMessageCallback\r\n");
}
else
{
...
```

Then, you write the callback function that's invoked when a message is received:

```c
static IOTHUBMESSAGE_DISPOSITION_RESULT IoTHubMessage(IOTHUB_MESSAGE_HANDLE message, void* userContextCallback)
{
    IOTHUBMESSAGE_DISPOSITION_RESULT result;
    const unsigned char* buffer;
    size_t size;
    if (IoTHubMessage_GetByteArray(message, &buffer, &size) != IOTHUB_MESSAGE_OK)
    {
        printf("unable to IoTHubMessage_GetByteArray\r\n");
        result = IOTHUBMESSAGE_ABANDONED;
    }
    else
    {
        /*buffer is not zero terminated*/
        char* temp = malloc(size + 1);
        if (temp == NULL)
        {
            printf("failed to malloc\r\n");
            result = IOTHUBMESSAGE_ABANDONED;
        }
        else
        {
            (void)memcpy(temp, buffer, size);
            temp[size] = '\0';
            EXECUTE_COMMAND_RESULT executeCommandResult = EXECUTE_COMMAND(userContextCallback, temp);
            result =
                (executeCommandResult == EXECUTE_COMMAND_ERROR) ? IOTHUBMESSAGE_ABANDONED :
                (executeCommandResult == EXECUTE_COMMAND_SUCCESS) ? IOTHUBMESSAGE_ACCEPTED :
                IOTHUBMESSAGE_REJECTED;
            free(temp);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

This code is boilerplate -- it's the same for any solution. This function receives the message and takes care of routing it to the appropriate function through the call to **EXECUTE\_COMMAND**. The function called at this point depends on the definition of the actions in your model.

When you define an action in your model, you're required to implement a function that's called when your device receives the corresponding message. For example, if your model defines this action:

```c
WITH_ACTION(SetAirResistance, int, Position)
```

Define a function with this signature:

```c
EXECUTE_COMMAND_RESULT SetAirResistance(ContosoAnemometer* device, int Position)
{
    (void)device;
    (void)printf("Setting Air Resistance Position to %d.\r\n", Position);
    return EXECUTE_COMMAND_SUCCESS;
}
```

Note how the name of the function matches the name of the action in the model and that the parameters of the function match the parameters specified for the action. The first parameter is always required and contains a pointer to the instance of your model.

When the device receives a message that matches this signature, the corresponding function is called. Therefore, aside from having to include the boilerplate code from **IoTHubMessage**, receiving messages is just a matter of defining a simple function for each action defined in your model.

### Uninitialize the library

When you're done sending data and receiving messages, you can uninitialize the IoT library:

```c
...
        DESTROY_MODEL_INSTANCE(myWeather);
    }
    IoTHubClient_LL_Destroy(iotHubClientHandle);
}
serializer_deinit();
```

Each of these three functions aligns with the three initialization functions described previously. Calling these APIs ensures that you free previously allocated resources.

This article covered the basics of using the libraries in the **Azure IoT device SDK for C**. It provided you with enough information to understand what's included in the SDK, its architecture, and how to get started working with the Windows samples. The next article continues the description of the SDK by explaining [more about the IoTHubClient library](iot-hub-device-sdk-c-iothubclient.md).
