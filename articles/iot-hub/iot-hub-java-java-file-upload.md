# Upload files from your device to the cloud with IoT Hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-file-upload-language-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-file-upload-language-selector.md)]

This tutorial builds on the code in the [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub](iot-hub-java-java-c2d.md) tutorial to show you how to use the [file upload capabilities of IoT Hub](iot-hub-devguide-file-upload.md) to upload a file to [Azure blob storage](../storage/index.yml). The tutorial shows you how to:

* Securely provide a device with an Azure blob URI for uploading a file.

* Use the IoT Hub file upload notifications to trigger processing the file in your app back end.

The [Send telemetry to IoT Hub (Java)](quickstart-send-telemetry-java.md) and [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub (Java)](iot-hub-java-java-c2d.md) tutorials show the basic device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging functionality of IoT Hub. The [Configure message routing with IoT Hub](tutorial-routing.md) tutorial describes a way to reliably store device-to-cloud messages in Azure blob storage. However, in some scenarios you cannot easily map the data your devices send into the relatively small device-to-cloud messages that IoT Hub accepts. For example:

* Large files that contain images
* Videos
* Vibration data sampled at high frequency
* Some form of preprocessed data.

These files are typically batch processed in the cloud using tools such as [Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/introduction.md) or the [Hadoop](../hdinsight/index.yml) stack. When you need to upland files from a device, you can still use the security and reliability of IoT Hub.

At the end of this tutorial you run two Java console apps:

* **simulated-device**, a modified version of the app created in the [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub] tutorial. This app uploads a file to storage using a SAS URI provided by your IoT hub.

* **read-file-upload-notification**, which receives file upload notifications from your IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub supports many device platforms and languages (including C, .NET, and Javascript) through Azure IoT device SDKs. Refer to the [Azure IoT Developer Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/develop/iot) for step-by-step instructions on how to connect your device to Azure IoT Hub.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* The latest [Java SE Development Kit 8](https://aka.ms/azure-jdks)

* [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.)

## Upload a file from a device app

In this section, you modify the device app you created in [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub](iot-hub-java-java-c2d.md) to upload a file to IoT hub.

1. Copy an image file to the `simulated-device` folder and rename it `myimage.png`.

2. Using a text editor, open the `simulated-device\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java` file.

3. Add the variable declaration to the **App** class:

    ```java
    private static String fileName = "myimage.png";
    ```

4. To process file upload status callback messages, add the following nested class to the **App** class:

    ```java
    // Define a callback method to print status codes from IoT Hub.
    protected static class FileUploadStatusCallBack implements IotHubEventCallback {
      public void execute(IotHubStatusCode status, Object context) {
        System.out.println("IoT Hub responded to file upload for " + fileName
            + " operation with status " + status.name());
      }
    }
    ```

5. To upload images to IoT Hub, add the following method to the **App** class to upload images to IoT Hub:

    ```java
    // Use IoT Hub to upload a file asynchronously to Azure blob storage.
    private static void uploadFile(String fullFileName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException
    {
      File file = new File(fullFileName);
      InputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
      long streamLength = file.length();

      client.uploadToBlobAsync(fileName, inputStream, streamLength, new FileUploadStatusCallBack(), null);
    }
    ```

6. Modify the **main** method to call the **uploadFile** method as shown in the following snippet:

    ```java
    client.open();

    try
    {
      // Get the filename and start the upload.
      String fullFileName = System.getProperty("user.dir") + File.separator + fileName;
      uploadFile(fullFileName);
      System.out.println("File upload started with success");
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
      System.out.println("Exception uploading file: " + e.getCause() + " \nERROR: " + e.getMessage());
    }

    MessageSender sender = new MessageSender();
    ```

7. Use the following command to build the **simulated-device** app and check for errors:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

## Receive a file upload notification

In this section, you create a Java console app that receives file upload notification messages from IoT Hub.

You need the **iothubowner** connection string for your IoT Hub to complete this section. You can find the connection string in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) on the **Shared access policy** blade.

1. Create a Maven project called **read-file-upload-notification** using the following command at your command prompt. Note this command is a single, long command:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=read-file-upload-notification -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```

2. At your command prompt, navigate to the new `read-file-upload-notification` folder.

3. Using a text editor, open the `pom.xml` file in the `read-file-upload-notification` folder and add the following dependency to the **dependencies** node. Adding the dependency enables you to use the **iothub-java-service-client** package in your application to communicate with your IoT hub service:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot</groupId>
      <artifactId>iot-service-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.23</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can check for the latest version of **iot-service-client** using [Maven search](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22iot-service-client%22%20g%3A%22com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot%22).

4. Save and close the `pom.xml` file.

5. Using a text editor, open the `read-file-upload-notification\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java` file.

6. Add the following **import** statements to the file:

    ```java
    import com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.service.*;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.net.URISyntaxException;
    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
    ```

7. Add the following class-level variables to the **App** class:

    ```java
    private static final String connectionString = "{Your IoT Hub connection string}";
    private static final IotHubServiceClientProtocol protocol = IotHubServiceClientProtocol.AMQPS;
    private static FileUploadNotificationReceiver fileUploadNotificationReceiver = null;
    ```

8. To print information about the file upload to the console, add the following nested class to the **App** class:

    ```java
    // Create a thread to receive file upload notifications.
    private static class ShowFileUploadNotifications implements Runnable {
      public void run() {
        try {
          while (true) {
            System.out.println("Receive file upload notifications...");
            FileUploadNotification fileUploadNotification = fileUploadNotificationReceiver.receive();
            if (fileUploadNotification != null) {
              System.out.println("File Upload notification received");
              System.out.println("Device Id : " + fileUploadNotification.getDeviceId());
              System.out.println("Blob Uri: " + fileUploadNotification.getBlobUri());
              System.out.println("Blob Name: " + fileUploadNotification.getBlobName());
              System.out.println("Last Updated : " + fileUploadNotification.getLastUpdatedTimeDate());
              System.out.println("Blob Size (Bytes): " + fileUploadNotification.getBlobSizeInBytes());
              System.out.println("Enqueued Time: " + fileUploadNotification.getEnqueuedTimeUtcDate());
            }
          }
        } catch (Exception ex) {
          System.out.println("Exception reading reported properties: " + ex.getMessage());
        }
      }
    }
    ```

9. To start the thread that listens for file upload notifications, add the following code to the **main** method:

    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, URISyntaxException, Exception {
      ServiceClient serviceClient = ServiceClient.createFromConnectionString(connectionString, protocol);

      if (serviceClient != null) {
        serviceClient.open();

        // Get a file upload notification receiver from the ServiceClient.
        fileUploadNotificationReceiver = serviceClient.getFileUploadNotificationReceiver();
        fileUploadNotificationReceiver.open();

        // Start the thread to receive file upload notifications.
        ShowFileUploadNotifications showFileUploadNotifications = new ShowFileUploadNotifications();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
        executor.execute(showFileUploadNotifications);

        System.out.println("Press ENTER to exit.");
        System.in.read();
        executor.shutdownNow();
        System.out.println("Shutting down sample...");
        fileUploadNotificationReceiver.close();
        serviceClient.close();
      }
    }
    ```

10. Save and close the `read-file-upload-notification\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java` file.

11. Use the following command to build the **read-file-upload-notification** app and check for errors:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

## Run the applications

Now you are ready to run the applications.

At a command prompt in the `read-file-upload-notification` folder, run the following command:

```cmd/sh
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App"
```

At a command prompt in the `simulated-device` folder, run the following command:

```cmd/sh
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App"
```

The following screenshot shows the output from the **simulated-device** app:
