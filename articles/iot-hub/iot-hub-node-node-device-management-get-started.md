# Get started with device management (Node)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-dm-getstarted](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-dm-getstarted.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create an IoT Hub and create a device identity in your IoT hub.

* Create a simulated device app that contains a direct method that reboots that device. Direct methods are invoked from the cloud.

* Create a Node.js console app that calls the reboot direct method in the simulated device app through your IoT hub.

At the end of this tutorial, you have two Node.js console apps:

* **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.js**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, receives a reboot direct method, simulates a physical reboot, and reports the time for the last reboot.

* **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.js**, which calls a direct method in the simulated device app, displays the response, and displays the updated reported properties.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* Node.js version 4.0.x or later. [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/tree/master/doc/node-devbox-setup.md) describes how to install Node.js for this tutorial on either Windows or Linux.

* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.)

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

### Retrieve connection string for IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-find-connection-string](../../includes/iot-hub-include-find-connection-string.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity.md)]

## Create a simulated device app

In this section, you will perform the following steps:

* Create a Node.js console app that responds to a direct method called by the cloud

* Trigger a simulated device reboot

* Use the reported properties to enable device twin queries to identify devices and when they last rebooted

1. Create an empty folder called **manageddevice**.  In the **manageddevice** folder, create a package.json file using the following command at your command prompt.  Accept all the defaults:
      
    ```
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command prompt in the **manageddevice** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device** Device SDK package and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-mqtt --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.js** file in the **manageddevice** folder.

4. Add the following 'require' statements at the start of the **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var Client = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
    var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Mqtt;
    ```

5. Add a **connectionString** variable and use it to create a **Client** instance.  Replace the connection string with your device connection string.  
   
    ```
    var connectionString = 'HostName={youriothostname};DeviceId=myDeviceId;SharedAccessKey={yourdevicekey}';
    var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString, Protocol);
    ```

6. Add the following function to implement the direct method on the device
   
    ```
    var onReboot = function(request, response) {
   
        // Respond the cloud app for the direct method
        response.send(200, 'Reboot started', function(err) {
            if (err) {
                console.error('An error occurred when sending a method response:\n' + err.toString());
            } else {
                console.log('Response to method \'' + request.methodName + '\' sent successfully.');
            }
        });
   
        // Report the reboot before the physical restart
        var date = new Date();
        var patch = {
            iothubDM : {
                reboot : {
                    lastReboot : date.toISOString(),
                }
            }
        };
   
        // Get device Twin
        client.getTwin(function(err, twin) {
            if (err) {
                console.error('could not get twin');
            } else {
                console.log('twin acquired');
                twin.properties.reported.update(patch, function(err) {
                    if (err) throw err;
                    console.log('Device reboot twin state reported')
                });  
            }
        });
   
        // Add your device's reboot API for physical restart.
        console.log('Rebooting!');
    };
    ```

7. Open the connection to your IoT hub and start the direct method listener:

   
    ```
    client.open(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Could not open IotHub client');
        }  else {
            console.log('Client opened.  Waiting for reboot method.');
            client.onDeviceMethod('reboot', onReboot);
        }
    });
    ```

8. Save and close the **dmpatterns_getstarted_device.js** file.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the article, [Transient Fault Handling](/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults).

## Trigger a remote reboot on the device using a direct method

In this section, you create a Node.js console app that initiates a remote reboot on a device using a direct method. The app uses device twin queries to discover the last reboot time for that device.

1. Create an empty folder called **triggerrebootondevice**. In the **triggerrebootondevice** folder, create a package.json file using the following command at your command prompt. Accept all the defaults:
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command prompt in the **triggerrebootondevice** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub** Device SDK package and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iothub --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.js** file in the **triggerrebootondevice** folder.

4. Add the following 'require' statements at the start of the **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.js** file:

  
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var Registry = require('azure-iothub').Registry;
    var Client = require('azure-iothub').Client;
    ```

5. Add the following variable declarations and replace the placeholder values:

   
    ```
    var connectionString = '{iothubconnectionstring}';
    var registry = Registry.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
    var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
    var deviceToReboot = 'myDeviceId';
    ```

6. Add the following function to invoke the device method to reboot the target device:
   
    ```
    var startRebootDevice = function(twin) {
   
        var methodName = "reboot";
   
        var methodParams = {
            methodName: methodName,
            payload: null,
            timeoutInSeconds: 30
        };
   
        client.invokeDeviceMethod(deviceToReboot, methodParams, function(err, result) {
            if (err) {
                console.error("Direct method error: "+err.message);
            } else {
                console.log("Successfully invoked the device to reboot.");  
            }
        });
    };
    ```

7. Add the following function to query for the device and get the last reboot time:
   
    ```
    var queryTwinLastReboot = function() {
   
        registry.getTwin(deviceToReboot, function(err, twin){
   
            if (twin.properties.reported.iothubDM != null)
            {
                if (err) {
                    console.error('Could not query twins: ' + err.constructor.name + ': ' + err.message);
                } else {
                    var lastRebootTime = twin.properties.reported.iothubDM.reboot.lastReboot;
                    console.log('Last reboot time: ' + JSON.stringify(lastRebootTime, null, 2));
                }
            } else 
                console.log('Waiting for device to report last reboot time.');
        });
    };
    ```

8. Add the following code to call the functions that trigger the reboot direct method and query for the last reboot time:

   
    ```
    startRebootDevice();
    setInterval(queryTwinLastReboot, 2000);
    ```

9. Save and close the **dmpatterns_getstarted_service.js** file.

## Run the apps

You are now ready to run the apps.

1. At the command prompt in the **manageddevice** folder, run the following command to begin listening for the reboot direct method.

   
    ```
    node dmpatterns_getstarted_device.js
    ```

2. At the command prompt in the **triggerrebootondevice** folder, run the following command to trigger the remote reboot and query for the device twin to find the last reboot time.

   
    ```
    node dmpatterns_getstarted_service.js
    ```

3. You see the device response to the direct method in the console.
