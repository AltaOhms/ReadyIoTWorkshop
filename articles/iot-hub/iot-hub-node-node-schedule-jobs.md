# Schedule and broadcast jobs (Node)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-schedule-jobs](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-schedule-jobs.md)]

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables a back-end app to create and track jobs that schedule and update millions of devices.  Jobs can be used for the following actions:

* Update desired properties
* Update tags
* Invoke direct methods

Conceptually, a job wraps one of these actions and tracks the progress of execution against a set of devices, which is defined by a device twin query.  For example, a back-end app can use a job to invoke a reboot method on 10,000 devices, specified by a device twin query and scheduled at a future time. That application can then track progress as each of those devices receive and execute the reboot method.

Learn more about each of these capabilities in these articles:

* Device twin and properties: [Get started with device twins](iot-hub-node-node-twin-getstarted.md) and [Tutorial: How to use device twin properties](tutorial-device-twins.md)

* Direct methods: [IoT Hub developer guide - direct methods](iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods.md) and [Tutorial: direct methods](quickstart-control-device-node.md)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-whole.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Create a Node.js simulated device app that has a direct method, which enables **lockDoor**, which can be called by the solution back end.

* Create a Node.js console app that calls the **lockDoor** direct method in the simulated device app using a job and updates the desired properties using a device job.

At the end of this tutorial, you have two Node.js apps:

* **simDevice.js**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity and receives a **lockDoor** direct method.

* **scheduleJobService.js**, which calls a direct method in the simulated device app and updates the device twin's desired properties using a job.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* Node.js version 4.0.x or later
[Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/tree/master/doc/node-devbox-setup.md) describes how to install Node.js for this tutorial on either Windows or Linux.

* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.)

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

### Retrieve connection string for IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-find-connection-string](../../includes/iot-hub-include-find-connection-string.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity.md)]

## Create a simulated device app

In this section, you create a Node.js console app that responds to a direct method called by the cloud, which triggers a simulated **lockDoor** method.

1. Create a new empty folder called **simDevice**.  In the **simDevice** folder, create a package.json file using the following command at your command prompt.  Accept all the defaults:

   ```
   npm init
   ```

2. At your command prompt in the **simDevice** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device** Device SDK package and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** package:
   
   ```
   npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-mqtt --save
   ```

3. Using a text editor, create a new **simDevice.js** file in the **simDevice** folder.

4. Add the following 'require' statements at the start of the **simDevice.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var Client = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
    var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Mqtt;
    ```

5. Add a **connectionString** variable and use it to create a **Client** instance.  
   
    ```
    var connectionString = 'HostName={youriothostname};DeviceId={yourdeviceid};SharedAccessKey={yourdevicekey}';
    var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString, Protocol);
    ```

6. Add the following function to handle the **lockDoor** method.
   
    ```
    var onLockDoor = function(request, response) {
   
        // Respond the cloud app for the direct method
        response.send(200, function(err) {
            if (!err) {
                console.error('An error occurred when sending a method response:\n' + err.toString());
            } else {
                console.log('Response to method \'' + request.methodName + '\' sent successfully.');
            }
        });
   
        console.log('Locking Door!');
    };
    ```

7. Add the following code to register the handler for the **lockDoor** method.

   ```
   client.open(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Could not connect to IotHub client.');
        }  else {
            console.log('Client connected to IoT Hub. Register handler for lockDoor direct method.');
            client.onDeviceMethod('lockDoor', onLockDoor);
        }
   });
   ```

8. Save and close the **simDevice.js** file.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the article, [Transient Fault Handling](/azure/architecture/best-practices/transient-faults).

## Schedule jobs for calling a direct method and updating a device twin's properties

In this section, you create a Node.js console app that initiates a remote **lockDoor** on a device using a direct method and update the device twin's properties.

1. Create a new empty folder called **scheduleJobService**.  In the **scheduleJobService** folder, create a package.json file using the following command at your command prompt.  Accept all the defaults:

    ```
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command prompt in the **scheduleJobService** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub** Device SDK package and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iothub uuid --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a new **scheduleJobService.js** file in the **scheduleJobService** folder.

4. Add the following 'require' statements at the start of the **dmpatterns_gscheduleJobServiceetstarted_service.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var uuid = require('uuid');
    var JobClient = require('azure-iothub').JobClient;
    ```

5. Add the following variable declarations and replace the placeholder values:
   
    ```
    var connectionString = '{iothubconnectionstring}';
    var queryCondition = "deviceId IN ['myDeviceId']";
    var startTime = new Date();
    var maxExecutionTimeInSeconds =  300;
    var jobClient = JobClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
    ```

6. Add the following function that is used to monitor the execution of the job:
   
    ```
    function monitorJob (jobId, callback) {
        var jobMonitorInterval = setInterval(function() {
            jobClient.getJob(jobId, function(err, result) {
            if (err) {
                console.error('Could not get job status: ' + err.message);
            } else {
                console.log('Job: ' + jobId + ' - status: ' + result.status);
                if (result.status === 'completed' || result.status === 'failed' || result.status === 'cancelled') {
                clearInterval(jobMonitorInterval);
                callback(null, result);
                }
            }
            });
        }, 5000);
    }
    ```

7. Add the following code to schedule the job that calls the device method:
   
    ```
    var methodParams = {
        methodName: 'lockDoor',
        payload: null,
        responseTimeoutInSeconds: 15 // Timeout after 15 seconds if device is unable to process method
    };
   
    var methodJobId = uuid.v4();
    console.log('scheduling Device Method job with id: ' + methodJobId);
    jobClient.scheduleDeviceMethod(methodJobId,
                                queryCondition,
                                methodParams,
                                startTime,
                                maxExecutionTimeInSeconds,
                                function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Could not schedule device method job: ' + err.message);
        } else {
            monitorJob(methodJobId, function(err, result) {
                if (err) {
                    console.error('Could not monitor device method job: ' + err.message);
                } else {
                    console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
                }
            });
        }
    });
    ```

8. Add the following code to schedule the job to update the device twin:
   
    ```
    var twinPatch = {
       etag: '*',
       properties: {
           desired: {
               building: '43',
               floor: 3
           }
       }
    };
   
    var twinJobId = uuid.v4();
   
    console.log('scheduling Twin Update job with id: ' + twinJobId);
    jobClient.scheduleTwinUpdate(twinJobId,
                                queryCondition,
                                twinPatch,
                                startTime,
                                maxExecutionTimeInSeconds,
                                function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Could not schedule twin update job: ' + err.message);
        } else {
            monitorJob(twinJobId, function(err, result) {
                if (err) {
                    console.error('Could not monitor twin update job: ' + err.message);
                } else {
                    console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
                }
            });
        }
    });
    ```

9. Save and close the **scheduleJobService.js** file.

## Run the applications

You are now ready to run the applications.

1. At the command prompt in the **simDevice** folder, run the following command to begin listening for the reboot direct method.
   
    ```
    node simDevice.js
    ```

2. At the command prompt in the **scheduleJobService** folder, run the following command to trigger the jobs to lock the door and update the twin
   
    ```
    node scheduleJobService.js
    ```

3. You see the device response to the direct method in the console.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you used a job to schedule a direct method to a device and the update of the device twin's properties.
