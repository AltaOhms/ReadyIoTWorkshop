# Get started with device twins (Node)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-twin-get-started](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-twin-get-started.md)]

At the end of this tutorial, you will have two Node.js console apps:

* **AddTagsAndQuery.js**, a Node.js back-end app, which adds tags and queries device twins.

* **TwinSimulatedDevice.js**, a Node.js app, which simulates a device that connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and reports its connectivity condition.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [Azure IoT SDKs](iot-hub-devguide-sdks.md) provides information about the Azure IoT SDKs that you can use to build both device and back-end apps.
>

To complete this tutorial you need the following:

* Node.js version 4.0.x or later.

* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.)

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

### Retrieve connection string for IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-find-connection-string](../../includes/iot-hub-include-find-connection-string.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity.md)]

## Create the service app

In this section, you create a Node.js console app that adds location metadata to the device twin associated with **myDeviceId**. It then queries the device twins stored in the IoT hub selecting the devices located in the US, and then the ones that are reporting a cellular connection.

1. Create a new empty folder called **addtagsandqueryapp**. In the **addtagsandqueryapp** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command prompt. Accept all the defaults:

    ```
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command prompt in the **addtagsandqueryapp** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iothub --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a new **AddTagsAndQuery.js** file in the **addtagsandqueryapp** folder.

4. Add the following code to the **AddTagsAndQuery.js** file, and substitute the **{iot hub connection string}** placeholder with the IoT Hub connection string you copied when you created your hub:

   ``` javascript
        'use strict';
        var iothub = require('azure-iothub');
        var connectionString = '{iot hub connection string}';
        var registry = iothub.Registry.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
   
        registry.getTwin('myDeviceId', function(err, twin){
            if (err) {
                console.error(err.constructor.name + ': ' + err.message);
            } else {
                var patch = {
                    tags: {
                        location: {
                            region: 'US',
                            plant: 'Redmond43'
                      }
                    }
                };
   
                twin.update(patch, function(err) {
                  if (err) {
                    console.error('Could not update twin: ' + err.constructor.name + ': ' + err.message);
                  } else {
                    console.log(twin.deviceId + ' twin updated successfully');
                    queryTwins();
                  }
                });
            }
        });
   ```

    The **Registry** object exposes all the methods required to interact with device twins from the service. The previous code first initializes the **Registry** object, then retrieves the device twin for **myDeviceId**, and finally updates its tags with the desired location information.

    After updating the tags it calls the **queryTwins** function.

5. Add the following code at the end of  **AddTagsAndQuery.js** to implement the **queryTwins** function:

   ```javascript
        var queryTwins = function() {
            var query = registry.createQuery("SELECT * FROM devices WHERE tags.location.plant = 'Redmond43'", 100);
            query.nextAsTwin(function(err, results) {
                if (err) {
                    console.error('Failed to fetch the results: ' + err.message);
                } else {
                    console.log("Devices in Redmond43: " + results.map(function(twin) {return twin.deviceId}).join(','));
                }
            });
   
            query = registry.createQuery("SELECT * FROM devices WHERE tags.location.plant = 'Redmond43' AND properties.reported.connectivity.type = 'cellular'", 100);
            query.nextAsTwin(function(err, results) {
                if (err) {
                    console.error('Failed to fetch the results: ' + err.message);
                } else {
                    console.log("Devices in Redmond43 using cellular network: " + results.map(function(twin) {return twin.deviceId}).join(','));
                }
            });
        };
   ```

    The previous code executes two queries: the first selects only the device twins of devices located in the **Redmond43** plant, and the second refines the query to select only the devices that are also connected through cellular network.

    The previous code, when it creates the **query** object, specifies a maximum number of returned documents. The **query** object contains a **hasMoreResults** boolean property that you can use to invoke the **nextAsTwin** methods multiple times to retrieve all results. A method called **next** is available for results that are not device twins, for example, results of aggregation queries.

6. Run the application with:

    ```
        node AddTagsAndQuery.js
    ```

   You should see one device in the results for the query asking for all devices located in **Redmond43** and none for the query that restricts the results to devices that use a cellular network.
   
    ![See the one device in the query results](media/iot-hub-node-node-twin-getstarted/service1.png)

In the next section, you create a device app that reports the connectivity information and changes the result of the query in the previous section.

## Create the device app

In this section, you create a Node.js console app that connects to your hub as **myDeviceId**, and then updates its device twin's reported properties to contain the information that it is connected using a cellular network.

1. Create a new empty folder called **reportconnectivity**. In the **reportconnectivity** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command prompt. Accept all the defaults:
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```

2. At your command prompt in the **reportconnectivity** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device**, and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-mqtt --save
    ```

3. Using a text editor, create a new **ReportConnectivity.js** file in the **reportconnectivity** folder.

4. Add the following code to the **ReportConnectivity.js** file, and substitute the **{device connection string}** placeholder with the device connection string you copied when you created the **myDeviceId** device identity:

    ```
        'use strict';
        var Client = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Mqtt;
   
        var connectionString = '{device connection string}';
        var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString, Protocol);
   
        client.open(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('could not open IotHub client');
        }  else {
            console.log('client opened');
   
            client.getTwin(function(err, twin) {
            if (err) {
                console.error('could not get twin');
            } else {
                var patch = {
                    connectivity: {
                        type: 'cellular'
                    }
                };
   
                twin.properties.reported.update(patch, function(err) {
                    if (err) {
                        console.error('could not update twin');
                    } else {
                        console.log('twin state reported');
                        process.exit();
                    }
                });
            }
            });
        }
        });
    ```

    The **Client** object exposes all the methods you require to interact with device twins from the device. The previous code, after it initializes the **Client** object, retrieves the device twin for **myDeviceId** and updates its reported property with the connectivity information.

5. Run the device app

    ```   
        node ReportConnectivity.js
    ```

    You should see the message `twin state reported`.

6. Now that the device reported its connectivity information, it should appear in both queries. Go back in the **addtagsandqueryapp** folder and run the queries again:

    ```   
        node AddTagsAndQuery.js
    ```

    This time **myDeviceId** should appear in both query results.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the Azure portal, and then created a device identity in the IoT hub's identity registry. You added device metadata as tags from a back-end app, and wrote a simulated device app to report device connectivity information in the device twin. You also learned how to query this information using the SQL-like IoT Hub query language.

Use the following resources to learn how to:

* send telemetry from devices with the [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-node.md) tutorial,

* configure devices using device twin's desired properties with the [Use desired properties to configure devices](tutorial-device-twins.md) tutorial,

* control devices interactively (such as turning on a fan from a user-controlled app), with the [Use direct methods](quickstart-control-device-node.md) tutorial.
