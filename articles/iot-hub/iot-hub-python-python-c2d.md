# Send cloud-to-device messages with IoT Hub (Python)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-c2d](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-c2d.md)]

## Introduction
Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that helps enable reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of devices and a solution back end. The [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-python.md) quickstart shows how to create an IoT hub, provision a device identity in it, and code a simulated device app that sends device-to-cloud messages.

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-basic](../../includes/iot-hub-basic-whole.md)]

This tutorial builds on [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-python.md). It shows you how to:

* From your solution back end, send cloud-to-device messages to a single device through IoT Hub.

* Receive cloud-to-device messages on a device.

* From your solution back end, request delivery acknowledgement (*feedback*) for messages sent to a device from IoT Hub.

You can find more information on cloud-to-device messages in the [IoT Hub developer guide](iot-hub-devguide-messaging.md).

At the end of this tutorial, you run two Python console apps:

* **SimulatedDevice.py**, a modified version of the app created in [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-python.md), which connects to your IoT hub and receives cloud-to-device messages.

* **SendCloudToDeviceMessage.py**, which sends a cloud-to-device message to the simulated device app through IoT Hub, and then receives its delivery acknowledgement.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub has SDK support for many device platforms and languages (including C, Java, and Javascript) through Azure IoT device SDKs. For step-by-step instructions on how to connect your device to this tutorial's code, and generally to Azure IoT Hub, see the [Azure IoT Developer Center](https://www.azure.com/develop/iot).
>

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* [Python 2.x or 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to use the 32-bit or 64-bit installation as required by your setup. When prompted during the installation, make sure to add Python to your platform-specific environment variable. If you are using Python 2.x, you may need to [install or upgrade *pip*, the Python package management system](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

* If you are using Windows OS, then [Visual C++ redistributable package](https://www.microsoft.com/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48145) to allow the use of native DLLs from Python.

* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.)

> [!NOTE]
> The *pip* packages for `azure-iothub-service-client` and `azure-iothub-device-client` are currently available only for Windows OS. For Linux/Mac OS, please refer to the Linux and Mac OS-specific sections on the [Prepare your development environment for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-python/blob/master/doc/python-devbox-setup.md) post.

## Receive messages in the simulated device app

In this section, you create a Python console app to simulate the device and receive cloud-to-device messages from the IoT hub.

1. Using a text editor, create a **SimulatedDevice.py** file.

2. Add the following `import` statements and variables at the start of the **SimulatedDevice.py** file:

   ```python
    import time
    import sys
    import iothub_client
    from iothub_client import IoTHubClient, IoTHubClientError, IoTHubTransportProvider, IoTHubClientResult
    from iothub_client import IoTHubMessage, IoTHubMessageDispositionResult, IoTHubError

    RECEIVE_CONTEXT = 0
    WAIT_COUNT = 10
    RECEIVED_COUNT = 0
    RECEIVE_CALLBACKS = 0
    ```

3. Add the following code to **SimulatedDevice.py** file. Replace the "{deviceConnectionString}" placeholder value with the device connection string for the device you created in the [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-python.md) quickstart:

    ```python
    # choose AMQP or AMQP_WS as transport protocol
    PROTOCOL = IoTHubTransportProvider.AMQP
    CONNECTION_STRING = "{deviceConnectionString}"
    ```

4. Add the following function to print received messages to the console:

    ```python
    def receive_message_callback(message, counter):
        global RECEIVE_CALLBACKS
        message_buffer = message.get_bytearray()
        size = len(message_buffer)
        print ( "Received Message [%d]:" % counter )
        print ( "    Data: <<<%s>>> & Size=%d" % (message_buffer[:size].decode('utf-8'), size) )
        map_properties = message.properties()
        key_value_pair = map_properties.get_internals()
        print ( "    Properties: %s" % key_value_pair )
        counter += 1
        RECEIVE_CALLBACKS += 1
        print ( "    Total calls received: %d" % RECEIVE_CALLBACKS )
        return IoTHubMessageDispositionResult.ACCEPTED

    def iothub_client_init():
        client = IoTHubClient(CONNECTION_STRING, PROTOCOL)

        client.set_message_callback(receive_message_callback, RECEIVE_CONTEXT)

        return client

    def print_last_message_time(client):
        try:
            last_message = client.get_last_message_receive_time()
            print ( "Last Message: %s" % time.asctime(time.localtime(last_message)) )
            print ( "Actual time : %s" % time.asctime() )
        except IoTHubClientError as iothub_client_error:
            if iothub_client_error.args[0].result == IoTHubClientResult.INDEFINITE_TIME:
                print ( "No message received" )
            else:
                print ( iothub_client_error )
    ```

5. Add the following code to initialize the client and wait to receive the cloud-to-device message:

    ```python
    def iothub_client_init():
        client = IoTHubClient(CONNECTION_STRING, PROTOCOL)

        client.set_message_callback(receive_message_callback, RECEIVE_CONTEXT)

        return client

    def iothub_client_sample_run():
        try:
            client = iothub_client_init()

            while True:
                print ( "IoTHubClient waiting for commands, press Ctrl-C to exit" )

                status_counter = 0
                while status_counter <= WAIT_COUNT:
                    status = client.get_send_status()
                    print ( "Send status: %s" % status )
                    time.sleep(10)
                    status_counter += 1

        except IoTHubError as iothub_error:
            print ( "Unexpected error %s from IoTHub" % iothub_error )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "IoTHubClient sample stopped" )

        print_last_message_time(client)
    ```

6. Add the following main function:

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub Python sample..." )
        print ( "    Protocol %s" % PROTOCOL )
        print ( "    Connection string=%s" % CONNECTION_STRING )

        iothub_client_sample_run()
    ```

7. Save and close **SimulatedDevice.py** file.

## Send a cloud-to-device message

In this section, you create a Python console app that sends cloud-to-device messages to the simulated device app. You need the device ID of the device you added in the [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-python.md) quickstart. You also need the IoT Hub connection string for your hub that you can find in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Using a text editor, create a **SendCloudToDeviceMessage.py** file.

2. Add the following `import` statements and variables at the start of the **SendCloudToDeviceMessage.py** file:

    ```python
    import random
    import sys
    import iothub_service_client
    from iothub_service_client import IoTHubMessaging, IoTHubMessage, IoTHubError

    OPEN_CONTEXT = 0
    FEEDBACK_CONTEXT = 1
    MESSAGE_COUNT = 1
    AVG_WIND_SPEED = 10.0
    MSG_TXT = "{\"service client sent a message\": %.2f}"
    ```

3. Add the following code to **SendCloudToDeviceMessage.py** file. Replace the "{IoTHubConnectionString}" placeholder value with the IoT Hub connection string for the hub you created in the [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-python.md) quickstart. Replace the "{deviceId}" placeholder with the device ID of the device you added in the [Get started with IoT Hub](quickstart-send-telemetry-python.md) quickstart:

    ```python
    CONNECTION_STRING = "{IoTHubConnectionString}"
    DEVICE_ID = "{deviceId}"
    ```

4. Add the following function to print feedback messages to the console:

    ```python
    def open_complete_callback(context):
        print ( 'open_complete_callback called with context: {0}'.format(context) )

    def send_complete_callback(context, messaging_result):
        context = 0
        print ( 'send_complete_callback called with context : {0}'.format(context) )
        print ( 'messagingResult : {0}'.format(messaging_result) )
    ```

5. Add the following code to send a message to your device and handle the feedback message when the device acknowledges the cloud-to-device message:

    ```python
    def iothub_messaging_sample_run():
        try:
            iothub_messaging = IoTHubMessaging(CONNECTION_STRING)

            iothub_messaging.open(open_complete_callback, OPEN_CONTEXT)

            for i in range(0, MESSAGE_COUNT):
                print ( 'Sending message: {0}'.format(i) )
                msg_txt_formatted = MSG_TXT % (AVG_WIND_SPEED + (random.random() * 4 + 2))
                message = IoTHubMessage(bytearray(msg_txt_formatted, 'utf8'))

                # optional: assign ids
                message.message_id = "message_%d" % i
                message.correlation_id = "correlation_%d" % i
                # optional: assign properties
                prop_map = message.properties()
                prop_text = "PropMsg_%d" % i
                prop_map.add("Property", prop_text)

                iothub_messaging.send_async(DEVICE_ID, message, send_complete_callback, i)

            try:
                # Try Python 2.xx first
                raw_input("Press Enter to continue...\n")
            except:
                pass
                # Use Python 3.xx in the case of exception
                input("Press Enter to continue...\n")

            iothub_messaging.close()

        except IoTHubError as iothub_error:
            print ( "Unexpected error {0}" % iothub_error )
            return
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print ( "IoTHubMessaging sample stopped" )
    ```

6. Add the following main function:

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print ( "Starting the IoT Hub Service Client Messaging Python sample..." )
        print ( "    Connection string = {0}".format(CONNECTION_STRING) )
        print ( "    Device ID         = {0}".format(DEVICE_ID) )

        iothub_messaging_sample_run()
    ```

7. Save and close **SendCloudToDeviceMessage.py** file.
