# Connect Raspberry Pi to Azure IoT Hub (C)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-device-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-device-selector.md)]

In this tutorial, you begin by learning the basics of working with Raspberry Pi that's running Raspbian. You then learn how to seamlessly connect your devices to the cloud by using [Azure IoT Hub](about-iot-hub.md). For Windows 10 IoT Core samples, go to the [Windows Dev Center](https://www.windowsondevices.com/).

Don't have a kit yet? Try [Raspberry Pi online simulator](iot-hub-raspberry-pi-web-simulator-get-started.md). Or buy a new kit [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/develop/iot/starter-kits).

## What you do

* Create an IoT hub.

* Register a device for Pi in your IoT hub.

* Setup Raspberry Pi.

* Run a sample application on Pi to send sensor data to your IoT hub.

Connect Raspberry Pi to an IoT hub that you create. Then you run a sample application on Pi to collect temperature and humidity data from a BME280 sensor. Finally, you send the sensor data to your IoT hub.

## What you learn

* How to create an Azure IoT hub and get your new device connection string.

* How to connect Pi with a BME280 sensor.

* How to collect sensor data by running a sample application on Pi.

* How to send sensor data to your IoT hub.

## What you need

![What you need](./media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/0-starter-kit.png)

* The Raspberry Pi 2 or Raspberry Pi 3 board.

* An active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure account, [create a free Azure trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in just a few minutes.

* A monitor, a USB keyboard, and mouse that connect to Pi.

* A Mac or a PC that is running Windows or Linux.

* An Internet connection.

* A 16 GB or above microSD card.

* A USB-SD adapter or microSD card to burn the operating system image onto the microSD card.

* A 5-volt 2-amp power supply with the 6-foot micro USB cable.

The following items are optional:

* An assembled Adafruit BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor.

* A breadboard.

* 6 F/M jumper wires.

* A diffused 10-mm LED.

> [!NOTE]
> These items are optional because the code sample supports simulated sensor data.

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub.md)]

### Retrieve connection string for IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-find-connection-string](../../includes/iot-hub-include-find-connection-string.md)]

## Register a new device in the IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-device](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-device.md)]

## Set up Raspberry Pi

Now set up the Raspberry Pi.

### Install the Raspbian operating system for Pi

Prepare the microSD card for installation of the Raspbian image.

1. Download Raspbian.

   1. [Download Raspbian Stretch with Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (the .zip file).

   2. Extract the Raspbian image to a folder on your computer.

2. Install Raspbian to the microSD card.

   1. [Download and install the Etcher SD card burner utility](https://etcher.io/).

   2. Run Etcher and select the Raspbian image that you extracted in step 1.

   3. Select the microSD card drive. Note that Etcher may have already selected the correct drive.

   4. Click Flash to install Raspbian to the microSD card.

   5. Remove the microSD card from your computer when installation is complete. It's safe to remove the microSD card directly because Etcher automatically ejects or unmounts the microSD card upon completion.

   6. Insert the microSD card into Pi.

### Enable SSH and SPI

1. Connect Pi to the monitor, keyboard and mouse, start Pi and then sign in to Raspbian by using `pi` as the user name and `raspberry` as the password.
 
2. Click the Raspberry icon > **Preferences** > **Raspberry Pi Configuration**.

   ![The Raspbian Preferences menu](./media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/1-raspbian-preferences-menu.png)

3. On the **Interfaces** tab, set **SPI** and **SSH** to **Enable**, and then click **OK**. If you don't have physical sensors and want to use simulated sensor data, this step is optional.

   ![Enable SPI and SSH on Raspberry Pi](./media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/2-enable-spi-ssh-on-raspberry-pi.png)

> [!NOTE]
> To enable SSH and SPI, you can find more reference documents on [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) and [RASPI-CONFIG](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md).

### Connect the sensor to Pi

Use the breadboard and jumper wires to connect an LED and a BME280 to Pi as follows. If you don’t have the sensor, [skip this section](#connect-pi-to-the-network).

![The Raspberry Pi and sensor connection](./media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/3-raspberry-pi-sensor-connection.png)

The BME280 sensor can collect temperature and humidity data. And the LED will blink if there is a communication between device and the cloud.

For sensor pins, use the following wiring:

| Start (Sensor & LED)     | End (Board)            | Cable Color   |
| -----------------------  | ---------------------- | ------------: |
| LED VDD (Pin 5G)         | GPIO 4 (Pin 7)         | White cable   |
| LED GND (Pin 6G)         | GND (Pin 6)            | Black cable   |
| VDD (Pin 18F)            | 3.3V PWR (Pin 17)      | White cable   |
| GND (Pin 20F)            | GND (Pin 20)           | Black cable   |
| SCK (Pin 21F)            | SPI0 SCLK (Pin 23)     | Orange cable  |
| SDO (Pin 22F)            | SPI0 MISO (Pin 21)     | Yellow cable  |
| SDI (Pin 23F)            | SPI0 MOSI (Pin 19)     | Green cable   |
| CS (Pin 24F)             | SPI0 CS (Pin 24)       | Blue cable    |

After you've successfully connected BME280 to your Raspberry Pi, it should be like below image.

### Connect Pi to the network

Turn on Pi by using the micro USB cable and the power supply. Use the Ethernet cable to connect Pi to your wired network or follow the [instructions from the Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/software-guide/wifi/) to connect Pi to your wireless network. After your Pi has been successfully connected to the network, you need to take a note of the [IP address of your Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-3-network-setup/finding-your-pis-ip-address).

![Connected to wired network](./media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/5-power-on-pi.png)

## Run a sample application on Pi

### Sign into your Raspberry Pi

1. Use one of the following SSH clients from your host computer to connect to your Raspberry Pi.
   
   **Windows Users**
   1. Download and install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) for Windows. 
   1. Copy the IP address of your Pi into the Host name (or IP address) section and select SSH as the connection type.
   
   ![PuTTy](./media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started/7-putty-windows.png)

   **Mac and Ubuntu Users**

   Use the built-in SSH client on Ubuntu or macOS. You might need to run `ssh pi@<ip address of pi>` to connect Pi via SSH.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The default username is `pi` , and the password is `raspberry`.


### Configure the sample application

1. Clone the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install git-core
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-raspberrypi-client-app.git
   ```

2. Run setup script:

   ```bash
   cd ./iot-hub-c-raspberrypi-client-app
   sudo chmod u+x setup.sh
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

   > [!NOTE] 
   > If you **don't have a physical BME280**, you can use '--simulated-data' as command line parameter to simulate temperature&humidity data. `sudo ./setup.sh --simulated-data`
   >

### Build and run the sample application

1. Build the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cmake . && make
   ```
   
   ![Build output](./media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-kit-c-get-started/7-build-output.png)

1. Run the sample application by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo ./app '<DEVICE CONNECTION STRING>'
   ```

   > [!NOTE] 
   > Make sure you copy-paste the device connection string into the single quotes.
   >

You should see the following output that shows the sensor data and the messages that are sent to your IoT hub.

## Read the messages received by your hub

One way to monitor messages received by your IoT hub from your device is to use the Azure IoT Tools for Visual Studio Code. To learn more, see [Use Azure IoT Tools for Visual Studio Code to send and receive messages between your device and IoT Hub](iot-hub-vscode-iot-toolkit-cloud-device-messaging.md).

For more ways to process data sent by your device, continue on to the next section.

## Next steps

You’ve run a sample application to collect sensor data and send it to your IoT hub.
