## What you will learn

You will learn how to use Cloud Explorer for Visual Studio to monitor device-to-cloud messages and to send cloud-to-device messages. Device-to-cloud messages could be sensor data that your device collects and then sends to your IoT Hub. Cloud-to-device messages could be commands that your IoT Hub sends to your device. For example, blink an LED that is connected to your device.

## What you will do

- Use Cloud Explorer for Visual Studio to monitor device-to-cloud messages.
- Use Cloud Explorer for Visual Studio to send cloud-to-device messages.

## What you need

- An active Azure subscription.
- An Azure IoT Hub under your subscription.
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Update 8 or later
- Cloud Explorer component from Visual Studio Installer (selected by default with Azure Workload)

## Update Cloud Explorer to latest version

The Cloud Explorer component from Visual Studio Installer only supports monitoring device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messages. In order to send messages to device or cloud, you download and install the latest [Cloud Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.CloudExplorerForVS).

## Sign in to access your IoT Hub

1. In Visual Studio **Cloud Explorer** window, click the Account Management icon. You can open the Cloud Explorer window from **View** > **Cloud Explorer** menu.

## Monitor device-to-cloud messages

To monitor messages that are sent from your device to your IoT Hub, follow these steps:

1. Right-click your IoT Hub or device and select **Start Monitoring D2C Message**.

3. To stop monitoring, right-click on any IoT Hub or device and select **Stop Monitoring D2C Message**.

## Send cloud-to-device messages

To send a message from your IoT Hub to your device, follow these steps:

1. Right-click your device and select **Send C2D Message**.
