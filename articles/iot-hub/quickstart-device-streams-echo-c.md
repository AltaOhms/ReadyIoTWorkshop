# Quickstart: Communicate to a device application in C via IoT Hub device streams (preview)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-quickstarts-3-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-quickstarts-3-selector.md)]

Microsoft Azure IoT Hub currently supports device streams as a [preview feature](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

[IoT Hub device streams](./iot-hub-device-streams-overview.md) allow service and device applications to communicate in a secure and firewall-friendly manner. During public preview, the C SDK only supports device streams on the device side. As a result, this quickstart only covers instructions to run the device-side application. You should run an accompanying service-side application, which is available in the [C# quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-echo-csharp.md) or [Node.js quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-echo-nodejs.md).

The device-side C application in this quickstart has the following functionality:

* Establish a device stream to an IoT device.

* Receive data sent from the service-side and echo it back.

The code will demonstrate the initiation process of a device stream, as well as how to use it to send and receive data.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* The preview of device streams is currently only supported for IoT Hubs created in the following regions:

  * **Central US**
  * **Central US EUAP**

* Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) with the ['Desktop development with C++'](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/support/selecting-workloads-visual-studio-2017/) workload enabled.
* Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/).
* Run the following command to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI to your Cloud Shell instance. The IOT Extension adds IoT Hub, IoT Edge, and IoT Device Provisioning Service (DPS) specific commands to Azure CLI.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext
   ```

## Prepare the development environment

For this quickstart, you will be using the [Azure IoT device SDK for C](iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro.md). You will prepare a development environment used to clone and build the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) from GitHub. The SDK on GitHub includes the sample code used in this quickstart.

1. Download the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

    It is important that the Visual Studio prerequisites (Visual Studio and the 'Desktop development with C++' workload) are installed on your machine, **before** starting the `CMake` installation. Once the prerequisites are in place, and the download is verified, install the CMake build system.

2. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Execute the following command to clone the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git --recursive -b public-preview
    ```

    You should expect this operation to take a few minutes.

3. Create a `cmake` subdirectory in the root directory of the git repository, and navigate to that folder. 

    ```
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

4. Run the following commands from the `cmake` directory to build a version of the SDK specific to your development client platform.

   * In Linux:

      ```bash
      cmake ..
      make -j
      ```

   * In Windows, run the following commands in Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2015 or 2017. A Visual Studio solution for the simulated device will be generated in the `cmake` directory.

      ```cmd
      rem For VS2015
      cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015"

      rem Or for VS2017
      cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"

      rem Then build the project
      cmake --build . -- /m /p:Configuration=Release
      ```

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub-device-streams.md)]

## Register a device

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before it can connect. In this section, you will use the Azure Cloud Shell with the [IoT extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-iot-ext/iot?view=azure-cli-latest) to register a simulated device.

1. Run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to create the device identity.

   **YourIoTHubName**: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

   **MyDevice**: This is the name given for the registered device. Use MyDevice as shown. If you choose a different name for your device, you will also need to use that name throughout this article, and update the device name in the sample applications before you run them.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyDevice
    ```

2. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to get the _device connection string_ for the device you just registered:

   **YourIoTHubName**: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyDevice --output table
    ```

    Make a note of the device connection string, which looks like the following example:

   `HostName={YourIoTHubName}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyDevice;SharedAccessKey={YourSharedAccessKey}`

    You use this value later in the quickstart.

## Communicate between device and service via device streams

### Run the device-side application

To run the device-side application, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Provide your device credentials by editing the source file `iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_sample/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_sample.c` and providing your device connection string.

   ```C
   /* Paste in your iothub connection string  */
   static const char* connectionString = "[device connection string]";
   ```

2. Compile the code as follows:

   ```bash
   # In Linux
   # Go to the sample's folder cmake/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_sample
   make -j
   ```

   ```cmd
   rem In Windows
   rem Go to the cmake folder at the root of repo
   cmake --build . -- /m /p:Configuration=Release
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   # In Linux
   # Go to the sample's folder cmake/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_sample
   ./iothub_client_c2d_streaming_sample
   ```

   ```cmd
   rem In Windows
   rem Go to the sample's release folder cmake\iothub_client\samples\iothub_client_c2d_streaming_sample\Release
   iothub_client_c2d_streaming_sample.exe
   ```

### Run the service-side application

As mentioned previously, IoT Hub C SDK only supports device streams on the device side. To build and run the service-side application, follow the steps available in the [C# quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-echo-csharp.md) or the [Node.js quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-echo-nodejs.md).

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-quickstarts-clean-up-resources](../../includes/iot-hub-quickstarts-clean-up-resources-device-streams.md)]

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you have set up an IoT hub, registered a device, established a device stream between a C application on the device and another application on the service side, and used the stream to send data back and forth between the applications.
