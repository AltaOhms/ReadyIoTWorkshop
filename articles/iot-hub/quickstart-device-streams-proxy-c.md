# Quickstart: SSH/RDP over IoT Hub device streams using C proxy application (preview)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-quickstarts-4-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-quickstarts-4-selector.md)]

Microsoft Azure IoT Hub currently supports device streams as a [preview feature](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

[IoT Hub device streams](./iot-hub-device-streams-overview.md) allow service and device applications to communicate in a secure and firewall-friendly manner. See [this page](./iot-hub-device-streams-overview.md#local-proxy-sample-for-ssh-or-rdp) for an overview of the setup.

This document describes the setup for tunneling SSH traffic (using port 22) through device streams. The setup for RDP traffic is similar and requires a simple configuration change. Since device streams are application and protocol agnostic, the present quickstart can be modified (by changing the communication ports) to accommodate other types of application traffic.

## How it works?

The figure below illustrates the setup of how the device- and service-local proxy programs will enable end-to-end connectivity between the SSH client and SSH daemon processes. During public preview, the C SDK only supports device streams on the device side. As a result, this quickstart only covers instructions to run the device-local proxy application. You should run an accompanying service-local proxy application which is available in [C# quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-proxy-csharp.md) or [Node.js quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-proxy-nodejs.md) guides.

![Alt text](./media/quickstart-device-streams-proxy-csharp/device-stream-proxy-diagram.svg "Local proxy setup")

1. Service-local proxy connects to IoT hub and initiates a device stream to the target device.

2. Device-local proxy completes the stream initiation handshake and establishes an end-to-end streaming tunnel through IoT Hub's streaming endpoint to the service side.

3. Device-local proxy connects to the SSH daemon (SSHD) listening on port 22 on the device (this is configurable, as described [below](#run-the device-local-proxy-application)).

4. Service-local proxy awaits for new SSH connections from the user by listening on a designated port which in this case is port 2222 (this is also configurable, as described [below](#run-the-device-local-proxy-application)). When user connects via SSH client, the tunnel enables SSH application traffic to be transferred between the SSH client and server programs.

> [!NOTE]
> SSH traffic being sent over a device stream will be tunneled through IoT Hub's streaming endpoint rather than being sent directly between service and device. This provides [these benefits](./iot-hub-device-streams-overview.md#benefits). Furthermore, the figure illustrates the SSH daemon running on the same device (or machine) as the device-local proxy. In this quickstart, providing the SSH daemon IP address allows device-local proxy and daemon to run on different machines as well.

## Prerequisites

* The preview of device streams is currently only supported for IoT Hubs created in the following regions:

  * **Central US**
  * **Central US EUAP**

* Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) with the ['Desktop development with C++'](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/support/selecting-workloads-visual-studio-2017/) workload enabled.
* Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/).
* Run the following command to add the Microsoft Azure IoT Extension for Azure CLI to your Cloud Shell instance. The IOT Extension adds IoT Hub, IoT Edge, and IoT Device Provisioning Service (DPS) specific commands to Azure CLI.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az extension add --name azure-cli-iot-ext
   ```

## Prepare the development environment

For this quickstart, you will be using the [Azure IoT device SDK for C](iot-hub-device-sdk-c-intro.md). You will prepare a development environment used to clone and build the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) from GitHub. The SDK on GitHub includes the sample code used in this quickstart. 

1. Download the [CMake build system](https://cmake.org/download/).

    It is important that the Visual Studio prerequisites (Visual Studio and the 'Desktop development with C++' workload) are installed on your machine, **before** starting the `CMake` installation. Once the prerequisites are in place, and the download is verified, install the CMake build system.

2. Open a command prompt or Git Bash shell. Execute the following command to clone the [Azure IoT C SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c) GitHub repository:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c.git --recursive -b public-preview
    ```
    You should expect this operation to take several minutes to complete.

3. Create a `cmake` subdirectory in the root directory of the git repository, and navigate to that folder. 

    ```
    cd azure-iot-sdk-c
    mkdir cmake
    cd cmake
    ```

4. Run the following commands from the `cmake` directory to build a version of the SDK specific to your development client platform.

   * In Linux:

      ```bash
      cmake ..
      make -j
      ```

   * In Windows, run the following commands in Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio 2015 or 2017. A Visual Studio solution for the simulated device will be generated in the `cmake` directory.

      ```cmd
      rem For VS2015
      cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015"

      rem Or for VS2017
      cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017"

      rem Then build the project
      cmake --build . -- /m /p:Configuration=Release
      ```

## Create an IoT hub

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-include-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-include-create-hub-device-streams.md)]

## Register a device

A device must be registered with your IoT hub before it can connect. In this section, you will use the Azure Cloud Shell with the [IoT extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-cli-iot-ext/iot?view=azure-cli-latest) to register a simulated device.

1. Run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell to create the device identity.

   **YourIoTHubName**: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

   **MyDevice**: This is the name given for the registered device. Use MyDevice as shown. If you choose a different name for your device, you will also need to use that name throughout this article, and update the device name in the sample applications before you run them.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity create --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyDevice
    ```

2. Run the following commands in Azure Cloud Shell to get the _device connection string_ for the device you just registered:

   **YourIoTHubName**: Replace this placeholder below with the name you choose for your IoT hub.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az iot hub device-identity show-connection-string --hub-name YourIoTHubName --device-id MyDevice --output table
    ```

    Make a note of the device connection string, which looks like the following example:

   `HostName={YourIoTHubName}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=MyDevice;SharedAccessKey={YourSharedAccessKey}`

    You use this value later in the quickstart.

## SSH to a device via device streams

### Run the device-local proxy application

1. Edit the source file `iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_proxy_sample/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_proxy_sample.c` and provide your device connection string, target device IP/hostname, and the SSH port 22:

   ```C
   /* Paste in the your iothub connection string  */
   static const char* connectionString = "[Connection string of IoT Hub]";
   static const char* localHost = "[IP/Host of your target machine]"; // Address of the local server to connect to.
   static const size_t localPort = 22; // Port of the local server to connect to.
   ```

2. Compile the sample:

   ```bash
    # In Linux
    # Go to the sample's folder cmake/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_proxy_sample
    make -j
   ```

   ```cmd
    rem In Windows
    rem Go to cmake at root of repository
    cmake --build . -- /m /p:Configuration=Release
   ```

3. Run the compiled program on the device:

   ```bash
    # In Linux
    # Go to the sample's folder cmake/iothub_client/samples/iothub_client_c2d_streaming_proxy_sample
    ./iothub_client_c2d_streaming_proxy_sample
   ```

   ```cmd
    rem In Windows
    rem Go to the sample's release folder cmake\iothub_client\samples\iothub_client_c2d_streaming_proxy_sample\Release
    iothub_client_c2d_streaming_proxy_sample.exe
   ```

### Run the service-local proxy application

As discussed [previously](#how-it-works), establishing an end-to-end stream to tunnel SSH traffic requires a local proxy at each end (both on the service and the device). During public preview, IoT Hub C SDK only supports device streams on the device side. To build and run the service-local proxy, follow the steps available in the [C# quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-proxy-csharp.md) or the [Node.js quickstart](./quickstart-device-streams-proxy-nodejs.md).

### Establish an SSH session

After both the device- and service-local proxies are running, use your SSH client program and connect to the service-local proxy on port 2222 (instead of the SSH daemon directly).

```cmd/sh
ssh <username>@localhost -p 2222
```

At this point, you will be presented with the SSH login prompt to enter your credentials.

Console output on the device-local proxy which connects to the SSH daemon at `IP_address:22`:
